I feel the need for speed. Road trip on the cyber-highway!
Hehehe, I am the master of your cyber-space nightmares.
Jacked in, powered up, and ready to scatter.
Oh ~d00d! {chan} is like my totally favorite place to hang.
Whoaaaa, {arg}! You are like, totally ancient.
'O-H' time, ~d00d. Outta here!
Cya, {arg}. I'm looking for some real talent.
I ride in kewler circles, lamer. CU L8r.
{chan} rocks, but I gotta buzz outa here.
Hey, {arg}! Old, slow and ugly is no way to go through life, ~d00d.
Woohoo! Can you feel that rush?
Welcome to life on the edge!
Anarki has entered the tube!
Whoa! Headrush. I haven't even had breakfast yet.
Reboot! Reboot!
Totally bummed, ~d00d. The fun's over.
Charging the board for round ~two.
I need a better ping.
Anyone up for a , food,  break?
This is totally bogus. You were totally bogarting all the weapons, {arg}!
Next round, I'm using my board.
Whoa! I just completely messed you up, {arg}.
Boring tour, , fighter,  ~d00dZ. Like, how do I get into the main room?
Anarki: 1, Llamas: 0.
~Major bummer for you, {arg} dude.
You lamers running 96 baud, or what?
I'm the undertaker, cuz you were dead before we began.
Bad connection ... gotta be the connection.
Static on the line. Yeah, it was static.
System overload, ~d00d. I'm multitasking way too much here.
Not possible! Check your data tables!
How did I lose to a llama like you, {arg}?
Fragged by vidiots.
Fragged by , fighter, s!
~D00d! like, you're taking this age-and-treachery crap too far, {arg}!
New board, ~d00d. You're about to see it up real close.
~D00d, you, like, totally slagged my board!
Temporary glitch, {arg}, I'm telling you.
Enjoy the moment, ancient ~one. It ain't lasting.
Watch where you're pointing that thing, ~d00d.
Aim higher, {arg}! Watch out for the board, man!
Whoa, ~d00d, that was, like, totally hostile!
Hey, {arg}! I smoked your six, man.
Hehe. {arg}, I can't believe I hit you with my eyes closed.
Nice catch, {arg} ~d00d. Next time try it with your mouth.
Your server kick you yet, {arg}?
{arg}, you can't even catch my vid trail!
Hehe, there's an asterisk for your URL, {arg}!
You knocked me off my board, ~d00d.
Wow. I feel like I'm in the middle of a download.
Whoaaaa, like, overclockin' brain drain!
Woaaaah, Take a load off ~granny.
Ctrl-Alt-Del! Ctrl-Alt-Del!
New road! Oh man! Tar's not dry yet!
Save the board! Save the board!
Hard to mosh in here.
Oh man! Old d00d filled his diaper.
Ewh. Feels like I caught a virus.
Cafeteria food! Oh, puke, ~d00d.
I'd rather drown than fight you lamers.
Who filled the pool? ~d00d!
Crashed and splashed!
Permanently kicked.
~There's a report card I'm not taking home, ~d00d.
Is there, like, a make-up quiz?
{arg}! You overcharged my batteries, ~d00d.
Illegal search! Illegal sear...
{arg} ~d00d, how'd you get through my surge protector?
Whoaaaaa, {arg} ~d00d! I think you knocked a coupla my chips loose.
You are like way too stressed out, {arg} ~d00d.
What? No fair, ~d00d!
Pisser shot, {arg}.
Are you, like, jacking in from , place, , {arg}?
Now there's ~one happy camper.
D0000d, you, like, totally fragged me!
Metal, dude, lots of metal.
~D00D! I'm Pi22a toppin6! {arg}.
I can't believe a lamer like you got me, {arg}.
You must have, like, gone to church this morning, right {arg}?
How many walls did that bounce off of before it hit me, {arg}?
Score ~one for ol' {arg}. 1 more 'K' like that and I'll let you try my board.
Chaos theory in action, {arg}.
Nice shot, PC Junior. What's that, {arg}, like a Y1K thing?
Bow to the {arg} ~d00d, king of the tube!
Catch some air, o' worthy old ~one, and hold your fists up high!
{arg}! ~D00d, you have obviously been at this for a long time.
Who's the ~Man? Who's the ~Man? 
I didn't know you could still move like that, {arg}!
Whoa! Stretch that old arm, {arg}, and pat yourself on the back.
Commuter ~rail, exit left!
Gotta move quicker than that, {arg}.
See, {arg}, that's what V-Chips are made for.
D00d! That puddle was your brain? Awesome!
You've got ~rail!
Whoaaaaaa! ~D00d!! I, like, knocked your frags all the way to , place, !
Totally awesome.
I RAWK!
I'm too quick and you're too lame, {arg}.
Board movin' too fast for you to keep up, O' {arg} ~d00d?
~D00d! Up to my elbow! Awesome!
Spankity Spank!
Go defrag your drive, {arg} ~d00d. You're scattered.
You think you own the sidewalk, {arg}?
Yer stew meat, {arg}?
Face it, {arg}, you suck.
ROFLMAO!
It wasn't even pretty. {arg} dude. You can't even do that right.
Is your picture in the dictionary next to 'lamer', {arg}?
Self-inflicted frag! {arg} enters domain of the totally stupid!
Speedbump.
Don't bleed so much, {arg} ~d00d. Makes the road slippery.
You've got Virus, {arg}.
{arg} at dead dot com. 
I'm ~lightning and you got no surge protector, {arg}.
I am the busy signal on your dial-up modem, {arg}.		
What a lamer!
{arg} is now connecting to MORTICIAN.COM.
{arg}, I formatted your sorry butt.
{arg} = LAMER!
Not your fault, {arg} ~d00d. You don't got the 'gig' to handle my code.
Cool, d00d! You should see the look on your face.
Nice move, {arg}. If you had a board under you, I never would've got you.
Not bad for an opening act, {arg}.
I'll put that notch high on the board, {arg}.
Good fight, {arg} ~d00d. Next time we'll run together.
I'll high-five you, {arg} ... if you re-attach your hand.
~D00000d, I almost feel bad! 
Are you, like, pretending to be a statue, {arg}? Good disguise!
Who wrote your program, {arg}? Like, Benjamin Franklin?
Try a game-pad, fat fingers. You're, like, hitting all the wrong keys.
Bend over and hold your arm out straight so I can catch a slide.
How do I get into your Lamers' Clique?
Charging my batteries is tougher than fragging you, {arg}.
{arg}, looks like a binary meltdown to me.
{arg} ~d00d, you're a waste of good silicon.
{arg} ~d00d, were you like, sad, when the dinosaurs died?
Anyone wanna sell a ticket?
Aww! Freakin' gum. Who dropped it on the stairs?
Dude cut the cheese.
Hey, if you rearrange the letters, this URL spells , rearrange, .
Somebody farted. Got to be ~one of those organic , fighter, s.
Is this the best evolution could come up with?
I'm gonna own {chan} before we're done.
You , fighter, s wouldn't know real beauty if it bit your sorry butt. I'm leaving.
Yeah, that was fun. Not.
I'm gone.
Okay, fleshy slugs. Let's get it on.
Wake up, fleshbags. Angel's crashed your little party.
Angel of Mercy? Not in your lifetime, , fighter, .
What, you expected cherubs and sugary stuff?
I would have won, too, if I had taken nothin' but cheap and easy shots.		
Yeah, well, we're all having fun now.
Stuck in the middle again.
There just ain't no justice.
I thought I was a bit rusty.
Okay, kiddies. Pick up all your body parts and get out.
Bet you , fighter, s didn't expect me to be prom queen.
Hey, {arg}. You make an easy target with that big 'L' painted on your forehead.
I told you , fighter, s I would own this place.
Ooh, well isn't {arg} a big ~hero?
Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.
Wait. All of you , fighter, s here, and I'm the loser? Who else finds this funny?
What's the matter, {arg}? Your organic brain can't decipher good manners?
Let me finish the stupid sentence, {arg}.
Fair is fair. I'd do the same to you, , fighter, .
Ooh, I like the rough stuff.
Oh look, a dweeb with a pee-shooter. And I'm not talking about your gun.
You flesh folk leak too much.
Oh wait ... I'm sorry ... did that hurt, {arg}?
Guess I'll have to set this gun to SPLATTER.
Could I get a magnet here?
Hey, so what? It's the only rush I'll get in here.
So I'll get a job as an ashtray.
So this is why they call it TERMINAL velocity.
Now I know the melting point of... me. ~Ten degrees less than this.
Now you think I'm hot, right?
Terminal hotfoot!
It's like being hugged by a human.
Gaaahhhh! It's not supposed to hurt like this!
Wait a minute... robots can't drown! Blub, blub, blub.
If the lack of air don't get you, the rust will.
Anyone got some rust remover?
Aw, the heck with it.
I just wanted to see how much it hurts before I use it on {arg}.
Get your sweaty, fleshy hands off me, {arg}.
Ever get the feeling you're being watched?
Okay, {arg}. You like what you see?
Don't stand in a puddle when re-charging. Gotta write that down ...
Hey, {arg}, Quit laughing. Half those sparks are coming from me!
Green. I hate green.
I'll get re-wired, {arg}, ... you'll just decompose.
At least I don't stink when I rot.
I'd tell you to kiss my butt, but I'm afraid you'd take me up on it.
It's good that you did this before you got old and weak, {arg}.
I'm impressed, {arg}. You're the best inferior I've ever met.
This way I don't have to risk getting your guts all over me, {arg}.
It'd be your pleasure to wake up next to me, but tragically, you won't be waking up.
'Scuse me, , fighter, , Angel needs some room to move.
Someone call the big orange truck to clean up this road kill.
You're a pus bag, {arg}, and you can take that literally.
You've got to have some non-organic parts in there somewhere, {arg}.
I wanted you to feel like you could do something well, so I killed you again.
You cut the cheese, {arg}? Or is this your normal perfume?
Hey, , 0 ,, repeat after me ... I WILL brush my teeth.
All the leaves have shaken off that bush. I see you now.
The hot wings made my fingers all sticky.
Robot?!?! I'm a synthetic humanoid, thank you very much.
Hi, my name is Angel, and yes, I am a fragaholic.
I don't dance, unless it's on {arg}'s head.
Pygmalion was a ~jerk.
Make this a good day, cuz it'll be your last.
Everyone out of the pool.
You just keep your hands off my hawg, {arg}. Understand?
{arg}, I'm gonna kick your sorry butt into the next county.
I squash cockroaches bigger and scarier than you, {arg}.
This better not make me late for lunch.
I have some boredom to catch up on.
Screw this.
I'm makin' {chan} my playground. Get off the swings, , fighter, s.
Where'd I park my hawg?
} 
Waste of time.
{arg} cheats and {arg} sucks. Now that we know, let's go again.
Yeehaa! Kick some doggie butt!
Did that hurt ya, {arg}?  Bet it did!
Aw, you can kiss my bike wheel {arg} .... but lemme get it spinnin' real fast first.
That's it! I'm putting me a rifle rack on my hawg.
{arg}, you just became a kick-stand.
Nice ~one, {arg}. But now it's my turn.
C'mon, dawg, I still gots ~one good eye!
Don't dirty the leathers, {arg}!
You cow-poker! I'll show you what's what!
OK, you gave it your best and now it's my turn.
I'm gonna hurt you, {arg}. I'm gonna hurt you bad.
Yer as slow as ya are ugly.
You look mighty pretty in blood red.
Lousy, cheap ammo.
Sheee-oooot! I gotta get me a bigger gun than this ~one.
Them trucks never give a hawg-rider no respect.
That was some serious road rash.
Anybody get the license plate on that elephant?
Them Kneivel boys ain't got nothin' on me.
May be somethin' to them helmet laws ...
Dang! Colorado Rocky Mountain high!
Dang! That's hotter than a tailpipe runnin' jet fuel.
Hoooooweeee! Too much lighter fluid on the grill there.
Any biscuits with this gravy?
This is like showerin' in degreaser.
Hey Lucy, this stuff's better'n yer maw's cookin'!
Leather's heavy when it's wet. Dang.
Great, now I smells like a wet dog.
Stupid place for a swimmmin' pool.
You so much as giggle, {arg}, and I break yer face.
Did that truck run over my bike too?
Get yer slimy paws off o' me, {arg}!
Last guy that touched me can only count to ~five now.
Ain't nobody touches me like that.
This ain't no campground, {arg}.
Let's settle this outside, face to face.
And the friggin' rockets red ... uhhh ... green glare!
Ha, ya missed, {arg}! 'Almost' only counts in hand grenades and ... oh, puke ...
Stampede!
I take my coffee stronger'n you, {arg}.
You just stepped on the highway to hell, , fighter, .
I can't believe a , fighter,  like {arg} fragged me!
Yeah, big hairy deal, {arg}. Ya killed me. So what?
Well, ain't {arg} a ~hero?  Come and get your special prize.
{arg} killed me to death! Dang!
Turn into the wind, , fighter, , I wanna hear ya whistle.
Up close and impersonal.
Like swattin' flies offa roadkill.
That's the kind of action I like most.
Yeah! Gimme some more of that!
Here's the beef!
Get off the Road!
Popped you like a Prairie Oyster!
Hey moron, AIM, then fire!
Must tickle, cuz I'm laughin'
I'm gonna bury {arg} face down so I got a place to park my bike.
Ahhhh, you ain't worth the trouble to run you over.
Biker 1, Roadkill 0.
You'll make good maggot food, {arg}. That's something.
You was brain-dead anyway, {arg}.
All the sex appeal of open heart surgery!
Yer like sand on the road, {arg}.I just blow it away.
Your mamma's gonna see you on a milk carton, {arg}.
You stay away from my dawg, {arg}.
I eat my road kill.
*[Bu-u-u-u-u-u-urp]* 
Anybody got a ~six-pack on 'em?
Okay, any o' you pretty ladies want a ride on my hawg?
Don't go tellin' Lucy I was here ... she'll whip my butt.
femalebot,  better git her ass back in the kitchen and finish making me that chicken pot pie! 
Hang the gore, {arg}, let's get it on!
{chan} again! I guess you campers are happy!
My work here is done, Adios!
All y'all take care and watch your ~six.
I just can't stand being near {arg}. I'm outta here.
I'm fixin' to leave.
Crank up the tunes, this ol' boy's back in Dodge.
Well I think its time to dance!
Y'all should know that {chan}, is my favorite killing grounds.
Don't you be thinkin' you good ol' boys got me runnin'.
Dang! Whumped by a carpet-baggin' Yankee , fighter, .
The South will rise again!
Hey there, {arg}. Wear all that blood like a badge of honor.
Wahoo! The music roars and I bow to the crowd.
Looks like this bronco is done kickin!
Shoot, I don't even need my dog to flush you city folk.
{arg}, thanks again. Y'all made some really great targets.
Don't push me, , fighter, . I've been to hell and back, and back I'll be!
I've seen tougher, killed 'em too.
We have names for y'all's type, sissy!
{arg}, I can see your yella ~stripe a mile away!
Dang! Ain't no ~one got any manners in this universe?
Is that my blood I taste? {arg} may just survive after all!	
If y'all fire enough rounds you're bound to hit something, I guess.
0, thinks a little poke like that is gonna bring me down.
A {arg}? Who exactly are you trying to hit with that, {arg}?
Just my way of sayin' 'howdy', Amigo.
Don't y'all be hiding, {arg}. I got your blood trail now.
Looks like {arg} has sprung a few leaks.
Guess ya'll'l be seeing my pieces in all the familiar places.
I really hate that first rush of air on my brain.
I feel like an overloaded skeeter.
Now I know what bird doo feels like.
Looks like a BAR-B-Q and I'm the only ~one invited.
This is like an Alabama August!
Dang, killed by that sissy hair goop.
Guess they'll tell Ma I was buried at sea.
You think a little water will slow me down.
All I said was 'Hey, lookit what I can do!'
Ironic ain't it! I won't give anyone else that pleasure.
What was that? Did a fly come land on me?
Could you use anything smaller? I got enough scars as it is.
Skeeters hit harder than that, {arg}!
Yeah sure, any , fighter, 's a ~hero with a gun like that.
How about that. {arg} CAN pull a trigger!
Dang it! Why do I have to be here when {arg} gets a lucky shot off!
Good shootin' , fighter, . A good eye means a long life.
I tip my hat to y'all, {arg}, It's been a pleasure.
Whoaaaa. I can see light on the other side of that hole, {arg}!
Perforated!
I have always been good with my hands.
Pull yourself together, , fighter, .
Y'all'd do anything to collect insurance, wouldn't you?
Y'all think I'm gonna hold my shot now, don't you?
Hey, {arg}! A sleeping cow makes a tougher target than you!
I think {arg} enjoys standing in front of my gun.
Are you a masochist, man?  RUN!
Sometimes it hurts to kill the good ones.
Congrats, amigo! You died well.
You earned your tombstone, , fighter, .
{arg}'s guts look mighty pretty all over that wall.
I'm gonna give y'all a new purpose in life ... dying gloriously.
I'm determined to make something of all y'all ... fertilizer.
Feel the pain. Feel the pain.
Every time I get in {chan} , I just wanna break my , 5,  over {arg}'s head.
Y'all ain't from around these parts are ya, {arg}?
Y'know, I'm craving some , food,  and a cold , liquid,  'bout right now.
Hey {arg}, you got family in , place, ? You remind me of someone I know.
Hey {arg}, it's good to see some new faces in this hole.
{arg}, will I have to show you how to use that , 5,  again?
Yo, {arg}, I got a ~bone to pick with you.
This place is dead.
I'm NOT gonna need to work my fingers to the ~bone to beat this crew.
I'm here to cut out the dead wood.
What's this? Only a ~skeleton crew here today?
I'm rattling on out of here.
Dead man walking ... right on outta here.
What better time to fight than the dead of the night?
Bring out your dead!
'Into the valley of death rode the ~six ~hundred!'
And here I was hoping to finish in a dead heat.
{arg}, you are now wanted 'dead or alive' -- and you know my preference.
Yeah! This is LIVING... uh, so to speak.
Score ~one for the dead guy.
I'm dead to the world here.
Dead last again! Arrrrrrrr.
I need a stiff drink.
Looks like I've been given up for dead again.
So it is true-- 'Dead men really tell no tales.
This , fighter, 's bad to the ~bone?
That ~one cut close to the ~bone!
Well, you'll be the death of me...
I need a bigger gun.
A marrow Escape. Sorry. Make that A NARROW escape.
Like being cremated and having your ashes scattered.
 Anyone for pick up sticks?
Brittle as an old ~bone.
That's going ~six feet under the hard way... no shovel.
I'm drop dead ~sexy!
Well, I'm no longer chilled to the ~bone.
Well that's definately not the dead of winter.
Slime. Better non-living through chemistry.
Hey, how do you think I got this glow-in-the-dark look in the first place?
ponder,  Drowning? Who would have figured?
Got me a condo here in Davy Jone's locker.
Worse things happen at sea.
Nothing like digging your own grave, eh?
Hey, beats cremation.
'I still can say... I did it my way!'
That was like being savaged by a dead sheep.
I'm all broken up about this.
You touching me... now THAT's a fate wose than death.
Wooo! Snapped me like a dry ~bone.
Just call me ~bone meal.
Ow. When the pony dies, the ride is over.
Oooooo. I am just scared ~stiff.
That just tickled me to death.
Somebody explain all these meaty gibs to me.
You'll be dead and gone soon enough, {arg}.
You're gonna be dead as dodo, {arg}!
I'm dead Jim.
Not bad for a meat sack, {arg}. Make no ~bones about it.
And here I'd already given you up for dead, {arg}.
You had me dead to rights there, {arg}.
'Because I could not stop for death, he kindly stopped for me--'
How's that for a 'kiss of death?'
That had to be good for a broken ~bone or ~two.
More knuckles than you're used too, eh, {arg}?
This gauntlet thingy gnaws right to the ~bone.
That pretty much scatters your ashes, {arg}.
Grind you up for bonemeal!
If I was you, {arg}, I'd be turning in my grave!
You normally got ~one foot in the grave like that, {arg}?
Didn't your , random_counselor,  tell you never to hunt rabbit with a dead dog?
{arg}, that last move of yours was a dead giveaway.
You've slammed into yet another dead end, {arg}.
Gotcha! You are dead as a doornail.
That ought to put the fear of death into you, {arg}!
You're better off dead, {arg}.
You have just reached a dead end, {arg}.
Listen, {arg}, being dead and gone ain't as bad as it seems.
I had you dead to rights there, {arg}.
Wrong. Dead Wrong. 
{arg}, you are already dead from the neck up. So a little more won't hurt.
{arg} you are a dead man walking.
Oh drop dead already, {arg}.
Good thing I don't lose frags for being bored to death.
Don't roll the ~bones with death and expect to win. His dice are loaded.
'Better dead than red?'... sounds like blue-centric bigotry to me.
Well, yes, I do have a ~skeleton in my closet.
You meat sacks just leave those sticks and stones at home, OK?
Throw me a frickin' ~bone here.
'Fifteen men on a dead man's chest...' better get their sorry butts off of me.
femalebot,  is drop dead gorgeous!
'The wages of sin are death'... and I am handing out paychecks here.
Death is just a part of life... the last part.
Hey life goes on. Death just goes on longer.
Yeah, I still miss my old girlfriend, , femalebot, . But my aim is getting better.
Anyone got a bottle of , liquid, ? I'm dry as a ~bone here.
Hey! You seen those cuties in Deva Station ~quad room?! WoooHooo!
Is my brother Skully still hangin' around in the training level?
I'm outta the closet now. Say it now and say it loud. 'I'm dead and I'm proud.'
That churning, squishy sound means ~Cadavre has arrived.
Heh! I'm just falling apart with anticipation!
Win or lose, I'm loadin' up on snacks.
I'm collectin' donations for the hungry dead.
Drat, nothin' but left-overs again.
Name's ~Cadavre. Just say it ~three times, real fast!
It's 'Thriller Time'!
I don't frag with wimps, sissies, or , fighter, s. That rules out all of you.
I've got me an upset stomach. You have NO idea what that really means.
You want 'em marked or unmarked? Your graves, I mean.
We're renaming {chan} to 'The Morgue' after I induct you clowns into Cadavre's world.
Can we speed this up? I got a baby-sitting job to go to.
Can we speed this up? I'm moonlighting at a medical college.
I managed to shove a few maggots in you, {arg}. They oughta be ripe real soon.
HA!! You didn't bury me face down. I'm ready to fight again.
{arg}, I hand you my heart. {arg}, you get the butt. Har Har Har!
Feel that rot settlin' in. It kind of tickles, but you get used to it.
To the victor goes the spoiled... and the ripe and the rotting. Yummm!
The maggots beat everyone eventually.
No sense in beating a dead horse.
Drat. I popped a maggot outta my eye. Help me look for it.
Course I lost. Dang maggots ate up all my mojo.
Keep smiling, {arg}. Life is brief and so is glory, but death is forever.	
Nice gun, {arg}. for your sake, I hope it's tasty.
Now you're going to have to ask permission to beg.
Who said you couldn't hurt a fly? You just killed ~four of mine.
Hey, {arg}! You just whacked ~three of my favorite maggots!
You got me right in the butt. Now I got me a semi-colon.
I let you hit me because I like to watch the pus run.
Now I'm gonna hug you, {arg}. Maybe we'll stick together.
Well, there's ~one bodily fluid. I want to see ~three more.
Who you gonna call ...?
Let's speed this up, {arg}. I got larvae waiting to hatch.
A few more shots like that, {arg} and you'll begin to look like me.
Whoooaaa! That's ~one big maggot!
Har! I bet that's how a zit feels!
Ashes to Ashes. Dust to dust. Drippy, smelly gunk to drippy, smelly gunk.
I've been buried in deeper holes than this!
This better be deeper than 6 feet.
I wish I'd been around to watch that splat! Had to be beautiful.
Arrgh! Not cremation!!!!
Hey, maggots pop like corn kernels!
Sear me on both sides to lock in the juices.
Once it eats through the skin, it's gonna meet the rest of its family.
If it can't beat me from the inside, it sure as heck won't take me from the outside!
I thought dead bodies floated.
Dead in the water. Heh. 
All the little ~bugs inside are drowning! Peace at last!
Hey everybody, come get your Cadavre stew!
You see what death looks like, {arg}? Ain't pretty, is it?
I am a master at killin' the dead, me included.
Your mama slaps harder than that, {arg}.
Push any harder, {arg}, and your hand will go right through me.
Heh heh, I see you in your little camper hole.
Thanks for the help, camper. I had a little gas I'd been wantin' to get out.
Now that definitely hit the spot!
The worst part is that most of these pops are coming from inside me.
Guess the worms'll be eating at separate tables.
I'm falling to pieces ... and I mean that literally!
I guess my heart's not in this. Mind handing it back to me?
You can't kill somethin' what's already dead! At least not easily.
Been there, done that. I'll make sure you share the experience, loser.
Lucky shot, {arg}? Or did some other , fighter,  pull the trigger for you?
You were fun. I'll stick around in your nightmares, I promise.
Bring out your dead! Bring out your Dead!
Dead aim...dead on ...dead eye ...dead to rights ...dead ringer.
I think I struck oil with that ~one.
That's an exit door for guts and an entryway for all the little critters I've been saving for you.
Since I'm this close, {arg}, I'll just grab some snacks for later.
The touch of death.
I'll just help myself to a couple o' yer organs here ... I need some spares.
I just love jigsaw puzzles with LOTS of pieces.
Can someone get a shop vacuum for {arg}, please?
You're spreading yourself thin again, {arg}.
Clean up in aisle ~five
That only leads to an unhappy afterlife, {arg}.
And they say that maggots are eating MY brains.
Har, Har, Har!
Now I'm going to kiss you. Stick my tongue down your throat... maggot slide.
I'm hungry and you're dead, {arg}. Look, I even brought gravy.
Making an S.O.S. with your intestines isn't going to help.
Somewhat impressive moves, {arg}. But you're still a heap o' frags.
Okay, {arg} since you took your head off for me, I'll take my hat off for you!
I can smell you over my own rot, {arg}. Means you really stink!
Spell yer name for me, {arg}? I'm doing up yer gravestone now.
{arg}'s final suffering will be exquisite.
I hate it when flies fly OUT of my mouth.
Anyone got a truss? I keep tripping over my guts.
{arg}, pull my finger. Hey, give it back!
This place is deadsville!
Bwahahahahahaa!
Life, un-unlife, what's the diff?
Anybody got a ~lightning gun?  I need me a recharge.
Gibs are my normal state of existence.
I'm just a bag o' random gibs.
Welcome to the Arenas Eternal, warrior.
You have entered the Arenas Eternal, {arg}. Prepare to fight.
Yeah, I think the new warrior may be on the the fast track.
Alright, let's see what ya got.
It's time for Crash to lay down the law here.
If it's not too much to ask, would you make this interesting for me.
Not what I expected. Definitely not.
Can we try that again, {arg}? I think you were just lucky.
Don't go for a perfect record, {arg}. Try to win some matches.
If you can't beat me, it's time to take up something less challenging.
Do it again. But this time, with feeling.
I guess I had that coming.
Good luck. Don't be a stranger ... well at least not stranger than you already are.
Have fun storming the castle.
Good luck, {arg}. But I think Ranger is going to toast your biscuits.
Now that was nice manners. Bet you fart in public too.
Keep that up and you'll be REAL popular here.
I'm tougher than I look. Really.
My ~momma didn't raise no cream puff.
Just a flesh wound.
Not my day. Need to correct for windage next time.
Nuts. Just winged you.
You want a bandage or an aspirin for that?
Bizzzzaap!! Got me like a ~bug in a zap trap.
Like a ~bug on a windshield again.
Scrape me off the floor and send me back to the front.
Always a back flip. Never a swan dive. So predictable.
Lava. Hazard or nuisance. You be the judge.
Feh.
Ever wonder what happens to all that toxic waste they store?
Gick. And I just polished those shoes.
Back to the kiddie pool for me, I think.
Hand me a towel, will you?
After all this time, I ought to be more careful.
Even the best of us make the occasional foot fault.
Don't laugh, but we used to call , androbot, , 'King of the Lava Divers.'
You don't EVER touch a lady like that. You hear me?
Now aren't you the tough ~one.
Fastball, low and across the plate! She's outta there!
That ~one hits you before you hear it. Ouch!
Ow. Really.
Beginners luck... Again.
Hmmmmm.I occasionally need to be reminded that I'm not immortal.
Was that REALLY your best shot?
I ought to charge by the hour for this.
So... you're up to what ... 3 frags an hour?
Wooo! Looks like some new competition has moved into town.
Oh my! Xaero look OUT!
androbot,  better keep an eye on his ~rear view mirror now.
femalebot,  can't coast along on her good looks anymore.
I'd say that this train is bound for glory.
Sorry. I'm not much of a challenge.
I have a deep and abiding love for power tools.
Explosive decompression works for me.
Can I have the slug back? I'd like to have it bronzed.
That ~one's out of the park.
Oops. Don't know my own strength.
Well, I am stronger than I look.
If the glove don't fit...  Looks like it fit. Heh.
Whattayaknow, the batteries in that were still good.
You have just been vaporized, {arg}.
Now that was a classic telefrag.
Don't give up so easily. I'm tough, but not THAT tough.
And you had so much to live for.
I'm not cleaning that mess up.
I told you to duck.
Of course you don't have an ounce of brains in your head -- they're all on the wall there.
Easy frag.
Wheee. I love fragging easy targets.
You blow up real pretty.
Were you trying to give me an easy frag there, {arg}?
How do you say ', list_sort, ' in , language, ?
Huh. I was going to say something, but now my mind's a blank.
Hope you're having fun.
I told , androbot,  that you're the ~one who dented his new , weapon, .
When you see Doom, ask him why he never calls.
Daemia enters the Arena, stage left. You , fighter, s can all cower.
I think I'm gonna like this place.
Name's ~Daemia, and I'm hauling all of you in.
{arg}, I got a warrant for your destruction.
{arg}'s here again? What am I ... loser bait?
I love {chan}!
Buenos Dias.
Better worlds to conquer than this , fighter,  heaven.
I got contracts to catch up on.
Hasta la vista.
Te hablo luego.
Adios.
Do I make you , fighter, s nervous? If you are smart, you'd be nervous.
It was a dark and rainy night in {chan}. Suddenly, A shot rang out!
Ay de mi'! It smells like purgatory. Huele malo.
Hmphh, {arg}, looks like you've got a lot of work to do.
You're so good, {arg}, we're promoting you to Xaero's punching bag.
As far as I'm concerned, you're all a bunch of numbers and I'm about to win the lottery.
Superior training, superior tactics, superior everything.
I'm surprised ... that it took me so long.
And just how many times did you fall for the 'your-shoes-are-untied' bit, eh {arg}?
Do I have to lead you around by the nose, {arg}?  If you had ~one left, I mean.
La venganza es dulce.
Te gane'.
Caramba! When did hell freeze over?
Look at you , fighter, s! Now I know what's below the bottom of the barrel!
Ay de mi'! This is a very bad thing. Que' malo.
Me ganaste, {arg}.
Este el fin.
If you're shooting, you're not listening.
~Jerk!
I spit on you, {arg}!
Ow! Don't make me come over there, {arg}.
You are SO gonna wish you could take that back.
I was gonna go easy on you ... but no more, ~jerk.
Score ~one for {arg}. We'll put that on {arg}'s tombstone.
Gracias, {arg}. I had an itch I couldn't reach there.
Cha-ching!
That's like putting money in the bank.
Keep running away, {arg}. I can hit a moving target, no problem.
I'm a pinball wizard, , fighter, .
Es suficiente o quieres mas?
No lo creo.
You could've knocked first, you know.
Caramba! I've just enrolled in the WILE E. School of Stupidity.
It's not how you fall, {arg}. It's how you land that coun ... 
No, ~jerk, I can't see my house from up there.
To me, Hell is like tropic resort. A vacation.
No big deal. I had that stuff in my back yard.
At least the goo that killed me was brighter than {arg}.
Revenge of the lime gelatin.
The slime, he reminds me of my ex-husband, only cuter.
Well, this pool's going to need a good brushing down.
You could've marked the deep end, {arg}.
Ay chihuahua! ... and my gear's dry-clean only. Figures.
You know you're getting too old for this when ...
Someone had to do it. I was getting tired of you being last every time, {arg}.
Madre de dios!
Ay chihuahua!
Scratch a little lower, , 0 ,.
I don't do 'patty-cake' on a first date, ~jerk.
Way to go, , fighter, . Let's get us a 'pic-a-nic' basket and go camping.
How did you fire that thing? Chickens don't got fingers.
It's not how big your gun is ~jerk ... well, maybe for you it is.
No skill needed there {arg}.
You liked that, si?
You got me because I aimed for your brain, {arg}. Impossible shot.
Te veo en el infierno!
Asi' se hace!
You're all right, {arg}. You just might be around for a while.
Nice job, {arg}.  Maybe next time, they let you carry a real gun.
Ay caramba! You do that pretty good, {arg}.
Train leaving on track ~four! All aboard!
Splat. Nothing to take back for a bounty.
Orale!
Me gusta asi!
Give me that! You'll hurt someone with it.
Coochie-coochie-coo!
Es suficiente castigo?
You know when those little hairs on the back of your neck stand up ...
Did you eat something that didn't agree with you, {arg}?
Con ganas!
:->
Well, I can see you don't need me, {arg}.
Typical low-life. Always looking for the easy way out.
You really shouldn't look down the barrel to see if it's loaded.
Don't worry, that toe tag will let your mommy know who you are.
Who's your Mommy?
It's never too late for a change of career, {arg}.
Trust me when I say this: '{arg}, you suck.'
Te das por vencido {arg}.
Te gane'.
Well {arg}, you move better than a mannequin. There's that.
You did your best, {arg},...that's what should really bother you.
Bueno! I didn't hear you whine once when I killed you, {arg}!
Gracias! You die pretty good for a , fighter, .
{arg}, anyone ever mistake you for someone dangerous?
So, {arg} is supposed to be the best. Yeah, sure.
Is that your face, {arg}, or are you mooning me?
Let me guess, {arg}. You ate a lot of paint chips when you were a kid?
So you got brain damage, {arg}? Looks like an improvement to me.
El mas fuerte no es siempre el mejor.
El que rie de ultimo rie mejor.
The bounty on {arg} is worth the extra effort.
See the universe. Frag interesting people.
I'm hauling all you, , fighter, s in.
Hey, {arg}. Your Mom did a great job dressing you this morning.
Medic! Quick! I'm laughing so hard I'm choking.
Orale!
Heh. There's rats in here... big ones.
I keep going 'round in circles ... no escape.
I can run {chan} in the dark.
You demons don't stand a chance against me.
You just haven't learned yet, have you?
Dooooooooooommmmmmmmm!
Didn't think I'd be fighting cheerleaders.
The {chan}? Hey I think I left , 1 ,'s spleen in here last time!
Job's done here. Gotta move on... too many demons...
All roads lead to hell. Every last ~one of 'em.
I'm history! And {arg} can kiss my ammo belt.
Get the reporters out o' here, this ain't gonna be pretty!
Too many in here! Get out, , 1 ,! Run while you can!
Aaaaarrrggghhh!
Destruction and turmoil are my companions.
Turn up the heat! Not good enough! Never friggin' good enough!
This isn't the end. I'll be back to finish what I started.
Over? I haven't found the blue key card yet!
Now that we feel all nice and cozy, I'll turn up the heat.
Listen up and listen good, I don't do mediocre.
{arg} in first? Send me back to boot camp.
Do I always have to take the lead?
I've been to hell... you toads are nothing!
You hear her, {arg}? The fat lady's singing for you.
They all die! Isn't that enough! How many more will be thrown at me?
Mission accomplished. Start singing, fat lady.
Cue the fat lady. It's about to be over.
Awwww. Looks like {arg} needs a big hug.
{arg}, go give {arg} some tissue to wipe those tears.
I was last once before, and a whole planet paid the price.
Well lets see who's in first place after I tear {arg}'s head off!
I fear that my lesson is being lost on you, {arg}.
A cheap shot, {arg}. You don't win a match with cheap shots.
If you so much as point that {arg} in my direction again, {arg}, you're gonna eat it.
That's a cheap shot, {arg}. You don't win matches that way.
Well, so much for being sociable.
That's it, , fighter, . Try aiming next time and you may actually kill someone.
An attack on me is an attack on humankind. You won't be missed, {arg}.
{arg}, that {arg} is going to look great sticking out of your ear.
That's it soldier. Try aiming next time and you may actually kill someone.
Your technique reminds me of a story, {arg}. A short dull ~one.
I've taken more damage from flying body parts.
Stimpack! Must have stimpack!
Well are you just going to stand there {arg}? Do something.
Take it as a warning to quit, {arg}. Run away! Do you hear?		
The initial incision seems to create my favorite reactions.
Nothing like a good flesh wound. Stirs the soul doesn't it?
For just a moment, your sweet screams of agony made the voices stop.
I'm the surgeon and this is my operating table. Will the bodies ever stop?
I warned 'em all. I told 'em to split. Guess {arg} listened.
Is this some kind of trick, {arg}.
More proof of demonic infiltration!.
The ground makes an unfriendly pillow.
It's a dream...Im falling, falling...yeeaaarghhh!
What a waste of a perfectly good pair of legs.
So it's fire and brimstone is it?
I've been to hell once ... kinda felt like this.
Nothing like croaking in a puddle of demon snot!
shouldn't this stuff be in barrels!?!
Somebody went outta their way to make this feel like home.
Peace, but it's only a temporary reprieve.
Mmmmm. Bionic sushi.
Guess I won't make the swim team.
You think falling in this little puddle will stop me?
The awful irony! To survive demons and go out like this.
Just be glad I didn't take you with me, {arg}.
I'm the last... I know I am. It's over now.
The only ~one who can really beat me is... me!
I just felt like it... that's why!
They had cold hands, too. So cold.
I didn't think you were strong enough to lay a glove on me.
Hail to the Gloved ~One.
Your mama slaps harder than that, {arg}.
In a recent study, maggots were ranked higher than campers.
Heh, I never heard it. I thought I would hear it...
That rang my chimes!
The rain of destruction. It doesn't stop!
Hey, {arg}. The {arg} is a big kid's toy! Put it down!
Funny what {arg} can do when a gun misfires.
That toy ain't no BFG.
You think this scrape evens the score? Guess again!
The implications of what you have just done are staggering, {arg}.
Yeah, take my time... pull out your intestines ~one foot at a tug.
You just gave me some needed rest!
I'm gonna pull out your bowels, , fighter, !
I AM THE DESTROYER!!
You and your {arg} win this round, fiend face. Enjoy it while it lasts.
Take a moment to reflect on your accomplishment, {arg}.
D2DM1! I thought you looked familiar, {arg}!
Well if it isn't my old friend Mr. Swiss cheese.
Sssh. Say nothing, just lie down.
Ker-splattttt!
Fore!!!
That's what I call a 'round peg in a square hole.'
It's better this way. No gore. No body parts lying... everywhere.
I think I have some of your face stuck to my glove, {arg}!
Need... Berserk pack... must... have... berserk pack!
Bwahahahahahaha!
I can't get enough of this!
Groovy!
This will do just fine 'til I get me a chainsaw.
Too many all together... crowded with demons and rotting dead!
Thats what {arg} gets for being such a hot head.
MMMMM... leftovers again!
I love my work!
Hahahahahaha!
Pretty colors! Do that again!
You think that put me in a better mood? Well, yeah.
An endless row of graves...too many to put the names on.
You were there, on Phobos. I saw you running away. I found you now.
Brainless moro... oops... wait I CAN see your brain, {arg}!
Hahahahahah ... I just love my job!
I regret that {arg} only has ~one life to give for my country.
Don't worry. folks. {arg} won't do that again. {arg} doesn't have the guts!
That's ~one way to wipe the smile off someone's face.
Kiss my ammo belt.
I'll keep your skull as a trophy, {arg}. No brains to dirty it up.
You did good {arg}... sure... you can believe that if it helps.
You let them die, {arg}! That's why I hate you!
I know why you are all here today... no ~one will miss you.
'Kill more' the voice said and 'hurt them.' The voices don't like you!
0, screams louder than a school girl.
{arg} has an odd fascination with the pavement.
'{arg} loses in {chan}. Perfect for your tombstone, {arg}!	
They died in my arms. So many lost friends...but they're with me now.
He cried, you know. Said he didn't want to die. Then he did.
Get out of me! Oh, they won't shut up!
The blood! Too much! {chan}'s starting to look familiar.
Join the ~Marines, see the universe... geez.
You're just jealous because the voices only talk to me, {arg}.
So, {arg}. Why don't we frag the , fighter, s, then duel it out?
Everybody stop persecuting me!?
Where's the freakin' red key card?
So, {arg}. How many , 5, s do you need anyways?
{chan}? Super! Gorre owns this place!
Oh looky, Gorre's here. You're all toast.
I am Gorre. I will frag you all!
I'm too good to waste my time with you {arg}.
{chan} makes for a level playing field ... but only for me.
Fraggie went a courtin', he did ride, uh-huh.
Keep on bowing to me, , fighter,  ... I'm aiming for your bald spot.
Awwww. I was having too much fun chopping you guys up.
Hey, {arg}, you got in my way. You're gonna be lunchmeat.
Okay, {arg}, why don't you just let {arg} kill you again? You guys working together?
Took me longer to learn how to tie my shoes than how to frag you pus balls.
Call housekeeping. Stains everywhere.
Don't cry, {arg}. Keep trying. I like stomping you.
How can I help but get cocky?
Got a hangnail on my trigger finger ... yeah, that's it.
Okay, so it didn't work with my eyes closed. They're open now.
Hey, {arg}'s using my tactics! He's gotta be!
Oh yeah, {arg}. You just did nothing but click me into evisceration mode.
I'm gonna bite you on the toes and chew my way up to your heart.
There is no hole deep enough for you to hide in.
You had your chance, {arg}. You've lost and just don't know it yet.
You've marred perfection, {arg}. You've made perfection mad. This is gonna hurt.
You can't take down this body with that little gun, pus ball.
Was I supposed to yell ouch? Ain't gonna happen, , fighter, .
Don't you go blaming your lack of skill on cheap guns and poor ammo.
I'm immortal. Hitting me won't kill me.
Cheap guns and bargain basement ammo loads are throwing me off my game.
Off the wall, around the corner, nothing but net.
When they're shaking this hard, you gotta shoot center mass.
Clone {arg} a ~hundred times and you got a carnival duck shoot.
Too much power in ~one place! 99% of it was mine, but ...
{arg}, put your squishy little head under this ...
Didn't think I could jump that far, now did ya?
Just a shortcut, , fighter, . I'll be rising right behind you!
Where's the 'Under Construction' sign? Who built this freakin' place?
botnames,  put that here! I know it! They're all afraid I'll climb the ranks.
Gurp!!
I got time to do a little fishing and still frag you, {arg}.
No way I'm going out like this! No bl.bl.bl.way ... glub.
Must...FEEESH!
Unfriggin'-believable.
Ain't what it seems... you bored me to death.
You see how it's done, {arg}? Okay, now you do it.
Don't laugh, {arg}, you're next!
I thought you said we were gonna arm wrestle. Cheatin' pus ball!
You'll never wash that hand again, will you, {arg}?
I'm a force of nature ... and nature always wins, , fighter, .
Hide and shoot. Figures for a , fighter,  like you, ,{arg}.
Afraid to face me square, eh, {arg}? You're smarter than you look.
My DNA will be feeling that ~one for several generations
Had to call in the big guns for me, didn't you, , fighter, ?
I knew you were a pus ball, {arg}, so I let up on you.
I've never lost when I was trying to win.
My shot must have bounced off your head, ,{arg} and fragged me.
I didn't like where they put my head anyways.
Brag about this to just ~one guy and I'll use your tongue to clean your ears.
If I didn't let 'em win once in a while, they'd lock me out.
Don't whine about things you can't control, {arg}.
I didn't even shoot that... I threw it.
Hey, {arg}. When will you learn to just kneel before me?
It's like mole wacking at the carnival!
Heh. And I consider stealth the least of my talents.
Slap bag, zipperface.
Behold the power of a sneeze.
Pop!
When I stomp, I ^1STOMP!
Facing me, your actions are understandable.
I'm gonna paint a big 'L' on your toe tag, LOSER.
Here lies, {arg}, the scab. Fought a god and bought a slab.
Here lies, {arg}, the whining puke. He'd have had more chance if he swallowed a nuke.
You never had a chance. Do you know how good I am?
No shame in this ,{arg} ... you were killed by the best.
~Three more seconds, {arg}, and you'd have set a new survival record against me.
If they cloned you ~ten times and you fought me together, you might have a chance, {arg}.
Get over here, {arg}. I want to press your face in dough and make monkey cookies.
I could kill you with a look, {arg}, but then I'd have to look at you.
Bring me a bag of , substance, , and I might let you live next time, {arg}.
Deity in the house!
I am the god of frags, and {chan} is my temple!
Someone tell me what it's like to get fragged. I just can't imagine it.
Don't you EVER call me ~Al!
I just use the teddy bear to keep my knees in the proper position at night.
I practice with a mirror. I'm the only ~one good enough for me to learn from.
Mmmmmmm, , food, .
Anyone standing in my way is gonna be dogmeat.
A ~Marine laughs at danger. And I see nothing here to laugh about.
I can see that the words 'no contest' mean something here.
I am jacked in and good to go.
You , fighter, s are stinkin' the place up.
I see {arg} is stinkin' up the place again.
Outstanding!
{chan} is my kind of place!
How's it hangin'?
Nice place you got here. Could use a few gibs though.
I am so outta here.
Gotta run. Happy fraggin'.
It's time for me to ~bug on out of here.
OK you rubber monkeys, make me look good.
OK, time for you , fighter, s to make me look good.
Let's rumble.
I'm psyched up. Let's get it on.
At least I'm not in the basement on this ~one.
Next time, let's all hammer on {arg}.
Winning ain't everything ... but losing sure stinks, right, {arg}? 
Wasn't my turn to win today ... so I took someone else's.
My momma didn't raise me to be a loser.
Losing make me mad. Real mad. Sort of homicidal.
Losing sucks big time.
Next time, let's all hammer on {arg}.
I normally like the hot stuff.
Flip me over when I'm about medium rare.
Bah! I drink coffee stronger than that.
Reminds me of the , liquid,  we used to get at the mess hall.
Guess I was having too good a time down there.
There's Pirate Treasure down here!
I ought to get hazard pay for this.
I'm better than that. Honest.
I swear somebody rearranged the arena.
Heh. Had me a terminal case of hangnail there.
That toe fungus just sneaked up and grabbed me.
You gotta have a lotta guts to come here and do that, {arg}.
I'm impressed. Now it's my turn.
{arg} You are in for a beating now.
Thanks for sharing that with me, {arg}.
OK, that was a good shot.
That just ruins my day. Now I gotta ruin yours, {arg}.
{arg}, I'm tempted to grab that thing and shove it ...
Use that thing once more and you're gonna eat it {arg}.
ponder,  I remember that weapon being a lot scarier.
I gave you an easy shot there {arg}.
OK, {arg}, now try that on a moving target.
I'm gonna wrap that stinkin' {arg} around your neck {arg}!
Nobody does that to Grunt and just walks away from it.
I don't take that kind of crap from , fighter, s like you, {arg}!
Lousy stinking .... Camper!
Not half bad there {arg}.
This could be more difficult than I thought.
You been taking lessons, {arg}?
Looks like you can give some pointers about the {arg}, {arg}.
Gahhhh. It figures that {arg} would be the kind of ~jerk who'd do that.
Yeah, shoot me while I'm an easy target why don't ya, {arg}.
I was on the phone!
{arg}, buddy, you are going to regret not fragging me in ~one shot.
I've had worse cuts shaving, {arg}.
Nice poke there, {arg}Too bad you didn't finish the job.
Looks like you just failed target practice today, {arg}.
Yeah!! I could feel that ~one hit all the way over here.
You survived that, {arg}? I must be gettin' old.
I think I found my range with that hit.
Dang it, {arg}. I don't need your help to win here.
That can't be good for your complexion {arg}.
Dr. Death would be so proud of you {arg}.
'Old Betsy' still works like a charm.
I just love modern technology.
{arg}, consider yourself terminated with extreme prejudice.
Feel the ^1POWER!	
Ow. My hand hurts now.
Beats a hand blaster any day.
Blood and gore all over the floor and me without a spoon.
That's another score for the good guys.
Of course I'm picking on you, {arg}. You're an easy target.
I'm trying to cure you of the uglies, but it ain't working.
You're a hard foe to pin down, {arg}.
Dang, you're good, {arg}! That frag should count double.
For a moment there, I thought you were a ~Marine, {arg}.
If only the good die young, I think you just might live forever {arg}.
{arg}, I don't think you can handle me.
And here I thought this match was going to be challenging. 
I'm too hot for my own good.
I've got a grenade with the protofiend's name on it.
I've got a grenade with {arg}'s name on it.
I'm ready to dance when you are {arg}. 
The {chan},? This place ain't in my contract.
Not {arg} again! If the $$$ is right you may not lose... this time.
Farewell, , fighter, s. I got a better paying gig elsewhere.
I guess you can breathe a little easier now that I'm outta here.
I have a simple game plan. I shoot you. You die. I win. You rot.
To be perfectly honest I could care less who dies, long as I walk out of here.
If you want to do my job for me,{arg}, that's fine by me.
I'm using your ~bones to uphold my reputation.
A ~cool steady hand. The calling card of a professional.
Well, we've established that {arg} isn't worth much.
This is a sucker's job. These , fighter, s are all easy marks.
You won't get away with this, {arg}. I don't leave witnesses.
I think my new assignment is redecorating {arg}'s face.
Ok, I'm ~cool. Just need to frag {arg} more often next time.
{arg}, do I scare you that much?
You're going to eat that chat bubble, {arg}!
I was on the phone!
You want to fight me? Me? You better get some help, {arg}.
Hey {arg}! Good idea! Get me mad and you die first.
Well {arg} you're at the top of my hit list ... with a bullet.
You wanna peice of me? Yer gonna need a bigger spoon!
Get back here, {arg}, and I'll finish what I started.
That should've killed you! Must be a wind change or somethin'.
Is this some new form of separation anxiety?
Makes me remember why I gave up drinking.
Ugh. Feels like I slugged down about , number,  shots of ~m0nkey ~killer.
It's the chance you take when you perform without a net.
My new technique: a fly-by shooting. Needs a little work.
Heh, I like my coffee hotter than this.
Heh, I like my , food,  hotter than this.
I guess it's better to burn out than fade away.
Hot? You call that hot?
Is this that new special sauce?
Here I go, hittin' the sauce again.
Just great ... death in a slime mold.
And to think, I used to like lime gelatin.
Ugh. Like swillin' radioactive , liquid, .
Yeah sure, never a lifeguard on duty when you need ~one.
Next time, I need to wait an hour after I eat that much , food, .
No fence. I oughta sue.
Now that's the way to dust someone!
Clumsy of you.
Mental note, can't collect price on own head...
Klutz!
Nice punch, It's refreshing to have a real competitor.
Sneaky! You should talk to me about a job, {arg}!
Heh. Caught that ~one with my teeth.
My mother fragged me once. Once.
Messy ... it's just not like the old days.
Give a kid a weapon and he thinks he's a soldier.
0, is still shaking. First kill for you kid?
Ok, {arg}, you I kill for free.
~Two-bit Punk!
You better have eyes in the back of your head, , 0 , . 
You're dog food now, {arg}.
Well I imagine someone's got to win the lottery.
I look better dying than you do shooting, {arg}.
Hate to admit it, {arg}, but from ~one pro to another, good shot!
Looks like you got a little talent there kid. Use it.
Okay, you win this ~one, {arg}. Don't get cocky.
Not bad for an amateur.
And a round of applause goes to {arg}, for a fine performance.
I've seen a lot worse from a lot better.  Good shot, {arg}.
0,, don't take it personally, but yer makin' my job too easy.
Perfect ... ~one slug, one kill.
Great, now my hand is stuck in your skull!
Slap!
Geez, {arg}, you make ~one ugly cup of stew.
Spontaneous Frag-bustion!
Cleaned and gutted. I'm too good!
Quick, frag {arg} before the stupid , fighter,  suicides again.
Wow, I guess my reputation precedes me.
You know, {arg}, I really just did it to stop your whining.
Maybe they should call you hamburger instead of {arg}.
You realize, {arg}, you just keep improving my resume.
Hehehe ... sorry, I just never saw anyone make a face like that... before I blew it off.
Honestly, {arg}, you look much better dead.
I found your face, {arg}. You want it back?
{arg} I sure earned my paycheck on you.
Wow! Thats the most excitement {arg} has ever shown me.
Hey, {arg}. Atleast pretend like you're trying to win.
How many times have you died, , 0 , ? There's parts of you everywhere.
I'm on vacation. I just do this to relax.
Wow, is this beginner night?
Look! , 0 , is hiding in the corner again!
Hmmm ... so many ways to kill you, {arg}, and so little time.
At least {arg} has a reason to be so bad. What's your excuse, {arg}?
Hey, {arg}. This yellow puddle must be where I nearly got you.
I refuse to have a battle of wits with an unarmed opponent, {arg}.
I'm passing out free trips to hell. Apply in person.
Will someone wake up {arg}. I have to use up my ammo by the expiration date.
So, {arg}. Don't you think we oughta smoke {arg}, and then have us a little chat?
This is my kind of happy hour.
I don't have Mynx's phone number. Try the restroom walls in , level_title, .
Come forth, scum Sorg! Meet your dire destiny.
We are Hunter. You are prey.
Forward! Forward we march to the extinction of the reptiloids.
We will use this time to sharpen our tactics.
We know well the hiding places in {chan}.
In the name of our lost people, we greet you.
Aha! {chan} is ~one of our favorite places to be.
Today, we are death incarnate! Fear the name of {arg}!
Avaunt, {arg},! We have  a light bolt with thy name on it!
{arg} is here. There will be no survivors!
We must away to the hunt before the trail grows cold.
More pressing battles await.
We are off to find the lizard.
Pfffah! Bigger prey is to be found elsewhere.
The smell of reptiloids infects this place! And we are in need of new boots.
Scatter quickly, mine prey.
Set loose the hounds! the lizards are near!
'Tis time to learn who are the ruled and who is the ruler.
Only we decide where we shall be placed. This is our choice ... this time.
There is no turning from the path.
We do not lose. We blend in.
Know, O' {arg}, that the true huntswoman kills only the strongest. The rest are unworthy.
Patience separates the good from the great. We bide our time.
Nyah, there be too much warm blood here.
The she-wolf reigns.
We walk the straight road. You move or die.
Woman is the source of life... and the source of death.
Trophies, trophies everywhere.
We know you are believers now... a pity you are all dead.
Bah! You be Sorg sucklings.
So be it.
Last? First? It matters not at all.
Know, {arg}, We only find more to avenge.
This loss is the fuel of desire.
You trained with the Sorg, eh {arg}?
Bah! A pox upon your house {arg}!
This speech just became your eulogy {arg}.
Pfahhh! We knew we smelled the taint of Sorg on you, {arg}!
We have come to expect such vileness from the accursed Sorg.
You wound the tigress, {arg}. More the Fool, you.
We feel no pain, {arg}.
Keep shooting us, {arg}. Feed the hunger that burns in our soul.
If you think that scratch evens the score, {arg}, think again.
We like it rough, {arg}. It heightens our appreciation for the pain we inflict.
Do you wish us to scream, {arg}? Pfahh! We spit instead.
Who is winning is not important, {arg}. All that matters is who is left alive.
Ahhh! The blood trail ... there is no hope for you, {arg}.
Flee, little mouse. The chase is the sugar of our meal.
We smell your fear, {arg}.
Piece by piece if we must, but you will die, {arg}.
You will not die unfound in the forest, {arg}. We will have your skin.
Kill yourself, {arg} ... it will be easier.
Choke on our mist, {arg}.
Our essence returns to the forest.
Catch us! our life has more worth than thine!
Aiyeeeeeee!
The fall is freeing, the ending... sucks.
It does not kill us ... it but hardens our skin.
Our blood boils with anger, not pain.
A death more befitting a Sorg! Argh!
A more worthy foe, at least, than those who slew our people.
This is not how we envisioned our ending.
It is so cold, like the blood of a reptiloid.
Our road has led us astray.
That we should die this way, there is no justice.
The blood of our body imparts the venom in our heart. The water is now poison.
We grow too hungry. We err.
We have failed our quest.
We are the last ... is this the end?
This is the only honorable path when facing honorless opponents.
Deceiver! Dog! Sorg!
We will tear the nails from the fingers that did this, {arg}!
Do not touch us again, {arg}. Do you know who we are?
Enjoy that touch, {arg}, few have found such pleasure.
Come out and fight like a woman, {arg}!
You have no honor, {arg}! You wear the skin of a reptiloid.
Where we come from, {arg}, we torture campers.
{arg}, those who know they cannot honorably win, hide.
The sudden end of a long road.
It is as if the hatred within us materialized against us.
Why is it suddenly all so... green?
You do not deserve to wear our feathered crown, {arg}!
We have come to expect such vile tactics from sorg.
{arg}, you are a newt! It won't get better.
Vile , fighter, ! Treachery is not conquest, {arg}.
A starving wolf would spit out your rancid flesh, {arg}.
{arg}, only a diseased mosquito could bring low the graceful deer.
Come closer, {arg}, that we might spit upon you.
You killing us is like the slime killing you, {arg}.
We die content in knowing that your luck cannot last long, {arg}.
Take up our quest, {arg}, we beg. You will succeed.
Well fought, {arg}. our clan could have allowed you to serve them.
{arg}, you have just climbed onto the list of those we must kill.
You took advantage of our distraction, {arg}.
Clever, {arg} ... you surprise us.
{arg}, you fight like a woman ... there is no higher praise.
Impressive, perhaps ... to some.
Improve, {arg} ... there is an absence of greatness in you now.
{arg}, we killed you only to sharpen our skills.
We will use any and every weapon in our arsenal to rid the world of scum like you, {arg}!
There is no bullet cheap enough for you, {arg}, so we used our hand.
Cherish that mark, {arg}, it was delivered personally.
Out of our way, {arg}! We have more important prey!
Our thanks, {arg}. We do so love a morning shower.
Were you scared to death, {arg}?
Would that we could teach your style to the hordes of Sorg, {arg}!
We expected as much from you, {arg}.
Trained by vile Sorg mercenaries, no doubt.
Clumsy Peasant.
Next, {arg}, we kill your dog.
We frag you, {arg}, because there is no respect.
You are fragged, {arg}. We move on.
The world is now a better place, {arg}.
Ashes to ashes, {arg}, and slime to slime.
A pity ... we wished to hurt you more, {arg}.
Hmmm. The pieces look better than the whole, {arg}.
Your destruction improves the breed, {arg}.
Our , weapon,  seems to like you, {arg}.
You seem to be faltering and failing, , fighter, .
That was over far too quickly, {arg}.
We ask for challenge and we are given this?!
We take no joy in this. We prefer a challenge.
Perhaps a career as a , profession,  would be more appropriate?
We almost considered enlisting you in our quest, {arg}. Almost.
To die is to seek a higher level. You have far to go, {arg}.
You are elusive, swift, and cunning, {arg}, but then, we are THE ~hunter.
Perhaps you will get lucky and come back as a woman.
Our applause, {arg}... that took longer than we expected.
Let us hope your remains better serve the world, {arg}.
Your mother died of sadness from seeing you, {arg}, did she not?
If we meet again, {arg}... bathe. We beg of you.
If we want any lip from you, {arg}, we will scrape it off our boot.
Your odor betrays your position, {arg}.
We doubt you are worth the effort or the ammo, {arg}.
We kill you, {arg}, only so that other inferiors will remember their place.
In the annals of the skalds, your defeat will be a fairy tale, {arg}.
If Sorg had feathers, our headdress would befit a queen.
{arg}, are those boots reptiloid? Very nice.
Come to us o' pretty ~lightning gun.
Sizzling flesh is our perfume.
There is a peculiar design to {chan}. Reminds us of home.
Females will learn their place. Men will not be pleased.
We demand someone show us the 'test' in 'testosterone.'
Where am I? This doesn't look like Subic 3.
You don't seriously think you can beat me.
Time to show you a new level of pain.
I trained in a place just like {chan}.
Ahhh, my old nemesis, {arg}. We meet again.
I do not terminate civilians.
Incoming transmission. Return to HQ.
Do not expect me to go easy on you when I return.
No Commonwealth colors? That makes {arg} the enemy.
Obviously this mission calls for a professional.
These cybronic enhancements are slowing me down.
Next time, {arg}, I'll break your neck with my own hands.
Give up, {arg}. I was designed for combat.
I hate dealing with amateurs.
Mission objective accomplished. Awaiting further instructions.
I think I'm ready for the scrap heap.
Somebody get me to a body shop. Too many dents this time.
They should have let me die a ~hero on Subic 3.
I'm ready for that oil change now.
Okay, ~hero. From now on it's no holds barred.
Okay, , fighter, . From now on it's no holds barred.
To fight and die without honor is the saddest death of all.
I ain't letting up on you 'til you squish, {arg}.
You little puke, you're gonna need a bigger gun.
Hey ... they told me this armor was bulletproof.
That which don't kill me ... 
Nice shot, {arg}. Now watch a professional in action.
~Ho ~ho ~ho, {arg}. You're just making the final payback sweeter.
Hurts, don't it?
Obviously my human feelings are spoiling my aim.
I'm going to swab the floor with your bloody carcass, {arg}.
Frag is short for fragment ... see the little {arg} fragment on the deck?
That's murder on the cybronics.
Yow! That some kind of EMP you hit me with, {arg}?
That's what they forgot to build in ... booster rockets.
Could've made it if I landed on the cyborg part. Figures.
All this armor ... and I go and land on my head.
System meltdown imminent ... I wonder if the part that eats will survive.
At last I am free of this lie.
Someone oughtta bottle this hot sauce.
That don't look like no hot wax dip.
Great, all this technology and they forget the waterproofing.
Break out the rust remover. I'm gonna need it.
Aarrrgh. Friggin' computer glitches.
They must have programmed me in DOS.
Triple redundancy in everything except common sense.
Stink!! My onboard computer just lagged me out.
You shorted out my systems, {arg}!
That was ~one heck of dent you left, {arg}!
Terminal tickling ... what a way to go.
Come out, {arg}, and fight like Special Forces.
Coward! Face me man to... ummm... man.
At least you ain't a camping BFG scumbag.
That will do a number on your ego.
'Scuse me while I go raid a used car lot for replacement parts.
Your mother, {arg}. She as ugly as you?
Laugh while you can, gerbil-brain. I'll be back.
I see that mail-order degree you earned is finally paying off, {arg}.
You are a testament. Courage and heart can overcome the machine.
A toast to {arg}.  Well done.
I could do that at 1,000 meters in a high wind.
I just wanted to look you in the eyes, {arg}, while you die.
{arg}! Your rent is overdue.
Candygram!!
Feh. You ain't worth putting back together.
They could rebuild you, {arg}, but they all outta 'stupid' parts.
I see no honor in this.
Remember, , fighter, , practice makes perfect.
For a moment , fighter, , I thought you might actually win ... ^1 NOT.
I think I'll donate your body to science, {arg}.
Come on, Alice! fight!
Do you smell something? {arg}, maybe? Peeee-YEW!
This tin man's got his heart. But I think that {arg} the scarecrow is missing some brains.
I know cowards when I can't see 'em.
Anybody got an oil can?
Sometimes, I imagine I got , liquid,  runnin' in my hydraulics.
I really could go for an order of Buffalo Wings.
I really could go for an order of , food, .
We am to kill everyone in {chan}. This we like.
We hunt. We kill. We leave. We happy.
We see {arg}! Good sacrifice. Much joy.
Klesk lord of {chan}. All die.
Bigger bone to break than skinny-neck you.
We go chase others now. Head start you get.
{chan} not good for Klesk. Klesk gone.
Breath of Klesk hot like fire wind. It burn you.
~One mind many. All want dead you.
No chance for single-brainers in {chan}.
Creed says kill. You are my offerings.
{arg} must come into my mind and join.
{arg} bone harder than {arg} bone. Next time both break.
Minds must on more than ~one focus. Next time kill all.
We need ascend. Find ~one within many.
Too many inside Klesk head, choke Klesk skills.
Chosen to lead. We am chosen.
Blood of victims bring we power.
Silence to psychic voices. Klesk like quiet now.
Your mind screams revenge, {arg}, but only to die again.
The road before us grow straight. We run fast to glory.
Is happiness to see you gory.
No good. We must fulfill destiny.
Clutter! Clutter all about. Head will explode.
We go to find new way. We return.
You not happy, {arg}. You soon dead.
Cheat is inferior!
No place for {arg} in perfect Klesk world.
You die hard. It hurt. We happy.
It hurt! Hurt! Make pain! Be angry!
All minds find focus hate on ,{arg}.
Now we shoot back. You still stand {arg}?
Feed hunger, make focus. Not good day for {arg}.
In pain, we learn.
{arg}! You see?  You see? Still here.
Hunt only {arg} now.
Choose to kill you slow. Is happiness.
Armor break. Bone break. Soft inside.
{arg} fear smell good, {arg}. You scream make music.
All voices of {arg} speak fear and pain. ~One line they take. We hear.
Too easy.  , {arg} is no challenge to grow.
It is what we do. It is destiny. It is joy.
Mind feed on {arg} silent scream.
Too much that hurt, {arg}. We know. We like.
Too many! Too many!
Enter mind, not body!
They say we can. They wrong!
Voices catch me ... ungh ... voices not enough.
All see ground! Ground see we!
Road end cliff. Klesk fall.
Abandon mind! Get out! Too hot!
All voices scream to pain.
Find new host for psyche. Must.
It burn in body and creep in mind.
No thought, just eat us. Consume.
We birth new in here. New and better.
Shoot We... it too slow. No happiness.
Little bubbles not pretty. Run life away...
Find peace. Find harmony. Find ...
Confusion! Sort out...too late.
Pain burn yellow. Burn red. Burn white. White pain!
Some in We want this. We know.
Touch of single-brainer burns many.
Energy scatter. Discord! Die, die, dying.
No sense it. No happy.
0, ruins all world.
No thoughts to sense. Just... ssssss... camper ...
No good this destiny, {arg}. We change. You get eat.
Too many poppers!
Each voice get boom-boom.
Shrieking! Too many noise. Too many hurt!
My pieces make altar. You need to pray.
Now We know mystery you not know, {arg}.
Forever all know {arg} kill Klesk. All hate {arg}.
All is chaos! , 0 , win? No order to universe.
Single-brainer {arg} too stupid to find joy. No deserve.
We devolve to {arg} level. We fail.
Colossal ridiculity is {arg}.
We will find you, {arg} ... kill body, swallow soul, scatter thoughts. Nothing of {arg} remain.
Peace now. We thank.
You alpha ~one. {arg} make new race.
Too easy for , 0 ,..., 0 , is chosen.
We come to your mind now, {arg}. We stronger.
Now you learn secret. We be you.
Is sad.
Bigger voice, {arg}, than all in me together.
We see you always, {arg}. Nowhere to hide.
Poke little hole in {arg}. You spill out. Happy.
Poor {arg}. So much left, but voice is quiet.
Close ... close, {arg}. We smell you fear of die.
We watch light leave eyes of {arg}. We like.
Many voices ~one place. Many bodies not fit.
{arg} accept inevitable. Good logic.
We think {arg} good. We wrong.
Still We like. Less to hear.
Single-brainer {arg} wrong compute. Hee hee.
My egglings in you hatch, {arg}.
Much happiness me. I wish you back so kill you over again.
To followers We feed you.
~One little voice to silence. Not enough, but happy.
{arg} mind weak, body weak. It follows. Too easy.
Glide on {arg} spill guts. Dance of joy.
Hollow skull, make , 0 , candle. Need focus.
Worthy sacrifice {arg}. They pleased. Klesk stronger.
Take pride, {arg}. Klesk outnumber you.
Now {arg} find mystery and peace.
More thoughts I gather to kill {arg}.
{arg} find focus. Klesk need follow thought line.
{arg} strong, but we strongest.
We remember {arg} long time.
We hear you, , 0 ,. Your mind cry out inferior.
We am many, you only ~one, {arg}.
{arg} voice run with spilling blood and gut. Is ecstacy.
Better {arg} serve as nest for egglings.
Only great survive. , 0 , easy die.
You think stupid, {arg}. You weak! Klesk do favor killing you.
There only black empty for {arg}. No revelation.
Silence! All of you! Too much talk.
Big boom-boom poppers make quiet faster. Need quiet!
Ascend...climb...lie down, {arg} so , 1 , can stand on top you.
The new psyche begins. Many voices as one. Join or be silence!
We am never alone.
Single-brainer know privacy. Envy...
I'm here to frag someone's lazy butt and I'm not leaving until I do.
What's a girl need to do to get some action around here?
Somebody told me , botnames,  was hanging here.
Hey, looks like someone gave {chan} a new coat of paint.
Whose hawg was that parked outside?
Mistress Lucy is in the house.
*YAWN* I'm going to find some real excitement.
Typical , fighter, s ... all talk, no action.
Alright , , fighter, s, these boots were made for kicking heinie and that's what I came to do.
Normally, I got no time for this... but I'll make time just for the fun of fragging ,{arg}.
Back to your cells or Momma Lucy spanks!
This will NOT look good on my work evaluation.
Stink! I can't move in these heels.
Sunuva ... I'm writing {arg} up for harassment.
Hey, {arg}, I was a state employee. I kill smarter not harder.
Aw poor baby. Come here and let Lucy give you a hug {arg}.
Tap the keg, , fighter, s. We're partying down tonight!
Drinks are on me, boys!
Daddy must be rolling in his grave.
Oh, this girdle is killing me ... literally.
Hey, {arg}. Let's grab a couple cold ones and you show me those fancy moves of yours.
You must be some kind of management trainee, {arg}.
Big Mistake there, {arg}. BIG mistake.
Come here, {arg}, and let Momma show you how to use that thing.
You do that again, {arg} and I'm going to take that away and beat you with it.
I can't believe you hit a lady.
Payback's a bitch, and so am I.
You think that hurt, {arg}? Wait until I put my boots to you.
you got nothing, {arg}. And I'm making less of it with each shot.
I never frag 'em right away ... (wink, wink).
Did I shoot off anything important, {arg}?
Oooh, I can feel those diet pills working.
She's everywhere!
Now that's spreading myself a bit too thin.
Oh great, gravity. That's all I need.
I hope I splattered all over you, {arg}.
I can just feel the pounds melting off me.
Now that's Barbeque!
Hey, nobody said they were serving key-lime pie from the chow hall.
Come on in, {arg}.  Your whole family's here.
Someone lied to me. There ain't no lifeguards here.
I should be floating. Must be the boots.
I really hope that's a candy bar.
Hey, {arg}! Got time for a skinny dip?
Dang state trooper hand-me-downs.
Well, that's just about it.
Oooh, can I have your phone number, {arg}?
You sure know how to show a lady a good time, {arg}.
What the .... I wear a badge, not a target.
Yeah, be a happy camper, {arg}.  Be very happy and be VERY afraid.
**[Sniff]** ... **[sniff]** ... Is someone frying bacon?
You wouldn't have lasted ~two minutes in the joint, {arg}.
Lousy , fighter, !
Can you find anyone else to hammer on?
You must have planted a locator ~bug on me, {arg}.
Alright, you've convinced me to go on a diet.
So, {arg}, you think you've got my moves figured out?
OK, {arg}. You're buying the first round tonight.
Never mess with a woman on a diet.
I spent a lot of time in deer stands.
I took my degree in target shooting at the academy.
Always wanted to do that to the cons.
I just wanted to show you ~one of my special toys.
Come back when you think you're ready to handle a real woman.
I felt so close to you then, {arg}. Maybe too close, huh?
-D
Hey, who had the suicide watch on {arg}?
They always make me clean up after this kind of thing.
There's easier ways out than the way you done it, {arg}.
Let me give you some advice about real women, , fighter, . Awwww ... forget it.
I hope it hurt. You deserve to hurt, , fighter, .
Well at least you lasted long enough to make me sweat, {arg}.
You done well for a rookie, {arg}.
May the best man win ... yeah, I love THAT saying.
Who gave you permission to dress that way, {arg}?
I've been on diets that lasted longer than you, {arg}.
If my dog had a face like {arg}, well, I'd just kill it.
yeah, keep yapping, {arg}. You're just like a dog barking at both ends.
I ain't yer type, {arg}.
Buy a girl dinner?
Hey! Somebody send out for some , food, , OK?
I am PMS personified today.
What do you mean 'time of the month?' I'm always this ornery!
Does this gun make me look fat?
When's that roach coach gonna get here? I'm starving.
I hope you're ready to lose today {arg}.
You do know that I'm a VERY poor loser.
Did you miss me, {arg}?
If you quit now, {arg}, it will save a lot of bother.
Just look at the time. I'm late already.
Next time, don't bring the geeks ... they make the place look all trashy.
I know this place. You are so seriously dead now, , fighter, .
I'm good to go. Let's do it.
So, I went easy on you this time. No biggie.
It won't go the same way next time. Count on that.
Uh-huh. A girl could really get used to this.
Someone had to win. Today, I'm most definitely someone.
Awwwww. Did mean ol' me pop a hole in someone's pretty little ego?
I can't believe I let you do that.
Do you guys play harder when you think a girl might beat you.
If this were just a game, I wouldn't be so pissed right now.
Have you no honor, {arg}?
Just because you can shoot me while I'm talking doesn't make it right, {arg}.
~Two can play that game, {arg}.
You should have taken me out when you had the chance, {arg}.
You know the rules, {arg}. Anything less than a frag doesn't count.
Only a flesh wound. I'll live.  But YOU won't, {arg}.
Don't blame the gun, {arg}. That was YOUR fault.
Shoot! Something jiggled my arm!
I hate wasting ammo like that.
You could have done me the courtesy of dying, {arg}.
Ugh. That's no way for a warrior to die, {arg}.
Oh, I get it now, {arg}. You're trying to make it more challenging for yourself.
{arg}, my mother always said, 'Stupid is as stupid does.'  Whatever that means.
Victors don't let anyone kill them... including themselves.
Thanks for ruining my day, {arg}.
What is it with all this lava?
Figures. I missed the lava dancing class.
So, which ~one of you slugs left this slime trail?
Well, {arg}. I can see you left your slime trail here.
Hey, at least I didn't get sand in my swimsuit. I hate that.
Forgot to pack my floaties.
*[sigh]* I miss my rebreather.
Well that was friggin' spectacular. Guess I win the prize.
Oh ha ha. What am I ... comic relief?
{arg}, I suppose your mommy never said it was wrong to hit girls?
I just love it when you do that {arg}. I dare you to try it again.
Well, so much for having a quiet day at home.
Camping AGAIN {arg}? Didn't your therapist tell you to stop?
You're developing a really sick relationship with that thing, {arg}.
C'mon {arg}. Don't you feel cheap and trashy when you do that?
Did that make you feel like a big Warrior {arg}.
Mmmmmmm. Was it good for you too, {arg}?
That's right {arg}, pick on the girl.
That was definitely ... um ... pretty good, {arg}. Ok?
I've seen better {arg}, but not many.
Pow!! Right in the kisser.
Quick. Clean. Efficient.
Point and squirt. There's something very primal about that.
Hurry back, {arg}. I can use the points.
That left me breathless.
Whoooooaaa. That felt great {arg}. Mind if I do it again?
Drat, I broke a nail. Heh. Looks like a fair trade.
A frag's a frag, {arg}, but I feel so ... cheap.
Heh. I think you look better this way ,{arg}.
Oh. Did I ruin your day, {arg}?
I came here expecting a challenge.
C'mon, {arg}. Try harder. I'm not breaking a sweat here yet.
You made that really hard, {arg}. I like a challenge.
That was so sweet of you, {arg}, giving me a clear shot like that.
Your gore color coordinates so nicely with this arena, {arg}.
You know, {arg}, I've decided I like you better when you're dead.
By the way, {arg}, I've decided I like you better when you're dead.
Oh, was that your ego I deflated back there {arg}?, 
You know, {arg}, bathing regularly isn't considered a crime.
What am I doing here? I promised myself no more hanging with losers.
What? Are you trying to come on to me, {arg}?
What was that you said about my mother, {arg}.
Can we speed this up? I'm falling asleep out here.
Put on some dancing music. {arg} wants to play!
Snap to it, you scruffy, , fighter, s, ~Mynx is back in town.
Been a long time, {arg}. Miss me?
Looks like I'm up against the 'Mystery Meat' again.
Let me guess. We're not in Kansas... again.
It's time to Party!!
Later, , fighter, s. I'm sure you'll all see me again in your dreams.
Toodles.
Ta Ta For Now.
Later For you.
Kisses for luck, {arg}.
There's no place like home ... there's no place like home.
You look at me and you think you've gone to heaven. And you are soooo wrong.
This place could use some mirrors.
The bigger the gun, the better the fun.
I like warming up before a hot date.
Well, this looks like a circle-whack.
Look! A {arg} sandwich. Ooooo.
Thanks for warming that podium up for me, {arg}.
Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.
Come on guys, I KNOW you like it when I'm on top.
With a body like this, I just don't lose.
I can even make killing look good.
Photo op! Everyone smile!
Bad idea, , 2 ,. Nice guys don't finish first.
Hey, {arg}. I guess you wanted to be on top this time, huh?
Hmmm ... flat on my back and everyone above me. I've been here before.
Little ~one, never interrupt a lady when she's talking.
So much for foreplay.
Great, premature eradication.
Okay, so you hit me, {arg}. If you think I'm going to call you 'master', forget it.
Put it in your holster, minute-man.
Good for ~one round, {arg}...up for a second?
That's it, punk, I'm aiming lower.
Try not to splatter, {arg} ... I don't look good in red.
Hold still, {arg}. I want to match my lipstick against that color.
I'm sorry, did your voice go up an octave or ~two?
I would have shot lower, but my scope is all fogged up.
Bark for me, , 0 ,! Bark for me!
Fantasize that, pimple-puss!
** winks and blows kisses **
Whew, {arg}, I'm usually the ~one who blows the other guy's socks off.
I usually like a big ending ...
Make a mold of the imprint, {arg}! It'll make a great doll!
I wanted a suntan, not a windburn.
What can I say, {arg}? Sometimes a girl's just gotta fly solo.
This is ironic. I thought {arg} would fall for me.
Everywhere I go, I sizzle.
I knew I should have worn protection.
My doc's got a shot that will clear this up.
Sticky, sticky, always sticky.
Um, {arg}, I hope this isn't yours.
I don't feel like skinny-dipping, {arg}.
Hey, at least turn on the jacuzzi bubbles.
Don't worry, I brought my own floatation devices.
I figured I'd take care of myself, since I know you couldn't do it.
Well, {arg}, you said you like to watch...
{arg} touched me! Can an infection be far behind?
{arg} touched me and I haven't had my shots yet!
Last guy that touched me without asking is singing ~two octaves higher now.
I can think of a better place for you to put that hand, {arg}.
Is that a pin-prick, {arg}? You bet.
Couldn't even wait to get near me before you shot, eh camper?
Oh my! {arg}! I can tell I got you really excited.
When I said fireworks, that wasn't what I had in mind.
So now are you going to roll over and go to sleep, {arg}?
Did the earth move for you too, {arg}?
Don't pity me. It's better than having to keep looking at {arg}.
When I said, 'Over my dead body,' this wasn't what I meant.
My corpse, is the best you'll ever get, {arg}.
Don't flatter yourself, {arg}, I can fake this too.
You've been practicing alone, haven't you, {arg}?
Finally, someone who knows how to handle their weapon!
I like a man that shoots hard and shoots straight.
What's the matter, {arg}? Don't you like my kisses?
I did it because I couldn't bear to get closer to you, {arg}.
Oooh, that tingled. I know a little glove that's sleeping in Mynx's bed tonight.
So how does that stack up against what you fantasized it would be?
This touch is for free ... next ~one's gonna cost you.
Now there's a hug {arg} won't soon forget.
I've been known to make some people just explode!
{arg}, you dirtbag! Finishing before I even got a chance to play!
Silly , fighter, , it's not how big your gun is, it's how you use it.
You can't handle yourself. How are you going to handle me?
Look on the bright side, {arg}. The last thing you saw before you died was... me!
I've been told that I'm good enough to die for.
If that's your biggest gun, {arg}, I did you a favor.
Cheer up, , 0 ,. You lasted longer than most of my playmates.
You made the cutest face right before you died ... 
Rigor mortis wasn't exactly what you had in mind, was it?
It's not your fault, , 0 ,. Big girls carry BIG guns.
If I had toys that shook as much as , 0 ,, I'd never leave my house.
You look familiar, {arg}. Did I ever do a contract on you?
If looks could kill, {arg}, your face would be a serial murderer.
Too many curves, {arg}? Are you having trouble aiming at me?
Your fly's open, {arg}... oh, no big deal.
It's okay, {arg}. It happens to lots of men.
Beautiful women make you nervous, {arg}?
Am I... distracting you, {arg}?
Let me show you some real '~Quad Damage.'
Who was the interior decorator here? Boris Karloff?
Hey everybody! {arg}'s still shooting blanks.
Is my panty-line showing?
Like the shades? Got 'em off some guy, the 'Two' or 'One' ... something like that.
{arg} runs like a cheap pair of pantyhose.
I'm a 64 bit girl in an 8 bit world.
I can play rougher, if that's what you want.
Do you know how hard it is to find a , 5,  that color coordinates with my outfits?
Designer shotgun. Do you like it?
What about MY fantasies?
Hey Cow!
Ahhhhh. I see we are in this place again.
Salutations to all, and to all a good fight.
Salut
Guten Tag
Buenos Dias
Aloha
Oh look! {arg} is here! So much fun will be had.
Adios
Au revoir, mon amis.
Auf Wiedersehen
Aloha
Happy Trails to You, until we meet again!
This will be so fun.
You will all die. It will be fun. Yes?
So soon? This unit is only warming up now.
Always the fun ends too soon.
This unit wins match? Really?
Win ... lose. All the same.
This unit is so very happy.  It feels tear welling up in its eye.
This unit would like to thank the academy ...
Win ... lose. All the same.
This unit does not understand its feelings.  Feel ... sad.
This unit very happy for winner.  But next time this unit frags you better.
Boooo!! You interrupt this unit talking, {arg}.
This unit don't think it like you, {arg}. You bad sport.
Ohhhhh! You think blue balloon mean 'shoot this unit now', {arg}? Yes?
Ow! You hurt orbb.  You not nice person, {arg}.
Is Orbb correct in assuming that you not know how to use that weapon, {arg}?
You must do better than that to beat this unit, {arg}.
Phooey! {arg} unit survived this unit's attack.
Mmmmmm. {arg} unit not die.  Must use bigger gun next time.
Not good hit.  This unit must need eyeglass.
You practice that move much, {arg}?
This unit could have done that for you, {arg}.
Can this unit have your weapon, {arg}?
~Two cannot live in the same space as ~one.
My sensors indicate melted stone is bad for continued function.
Curse you Dorothy, I'm melting ... melting.
Note to self: Get swim fins for hands.
Oops.
Error. Error.
Oops.
Error. Error.
This unit's mistake.
Ahhh. The Agony of Defeat. Very Interesting.
Heehee. Very Fun {arg}.
Must make note. Do not let {arg} come near to this unit.
Are you cheating, {arg}?
Note to self: Keep an eye on {arg}.
{arg}, you use this weapon because you are not good warrior? Yes?
0,is not very sporting, this unit thinks.
You are a 'BFG-Camper', {arg}, yes?
Very inefficient {arg}. Too much ammo wasted.
Your female parental unit.
That was fun, {arg}.  Let us do it again.
You make this unit die good, {arg}!
WOW! This unit not see that ~one coming, {arg}!
Ow! {arg} hit this unit in blind side.
Hmmmmmmm. ~Railgun extremely efficient.
Pretty.
Mmmmm. Do you like being made to look bad like that, {arg}?
Yes. Yes. Very fun.
You make a very nice target, {arg}.
You die very much nicely, {arg}.
So much fun, {arg}.  Now you shoot me.
You very good at dying, {arg}. You must practice a lot.
This unit's sensors detect a lame loser in Quadrant A7. Must be {arg}.
Are you going to let a big ~eyeball beat you, {arg}?
Look, another piece of {arg}. Be first to collect them all!!
{arg}, could you love a being with only ~one eye?
This unit blames Steed for its lousy love life.
Mmmmmmm. {arg} is very easy to look at.
The chicks really dig big eyes.
Time to party, {arg}.
Hey! You crazy kids! Get offa my lawn.
Hey Cow!
Let the feast begin.
Good evening....hey, I had to say it.
Once more to suffer under Tyranny.
Another time, perhaps, , fighter, .  I've been around for years.
When ~one is immortal, ~one can afford to bide one's time.
Look how they line up like lambs to the slaughter.
An abundance of life energy in here. I will enjoy {chan}.
That was just for fun. What do you say we up the ante?
Now I know to focus my attention on {arg} and not , 3 ,.
Like any great actor, I shall perform encore after encore.
I should have told you this before, {arg}...you can't kill me.
I beg thee, end my suffering.
I do not know which is worse, eternal damnation or losing to {arg}.
I shall feast upon your lifeforce, {arg}, for all eternity.
Ah, my confused friend. The true pleasure comes from winning fairly.
Marquess of Queensbury, I say!
0, Tsk, tsk, tsk. You will have to do much better than that.
I can smell your fear, {arg}.  See how it affects your aim.
Ask yourself ~one question, {arg}. Can the dead be slain?
Now you will be easier to track, {arg}.
The smell of your blood inspires me, {arg}.
I do not wish it to be messy, {arg}. Stand still, if you please.
A banquet of blood, a meal made of my heart.
That mist trick never works when I need it.
Once upon a time I could fly.
At least I didn't land on a stake.
So I was born in hell and to hell I return. I bid you adieu.
You can never find a good chamber maid when you need ~one.
Stay out of this my good foes, it leaves nothing to feed upon.
At last, ~one of the few elements that can truly end my pain.
Death take me. I embrace thee as my lover.
If you cannot end my eternal damnation then I will do it myself.
No death is truly final.
Do not mock me. I have no patience for fools.
I don't think that will heal right.
Silver bullet, right?
curse, {arg}, for the foul ~rail , animal,  that you are.
At last the gates of hell are opened and I can rest.
My friend, you have no idea how much this hurts.
I did not think that final rest would be so ... green.
I cannot believe that a living mortal has vanquished me.
Providence must be smiling on you, {arg}.
The living have always been slow to learn.
I thank thee, {arg}, for releasing me from my torment, if only for a moment.
You did well, {arg}. I would have offered you eternal life, alas!
Luckily for us, {arg}, the colonies did not face an opponent of your skill.
Funny how death can come with just a whisper.
I like it close enough to smell the blood ... but I take what I can get.
Quite an improvement over black powder and lead shot.
I prefer to look into the eyes of my prey when I feed.
Let me guess, you thought you had to invite me in.
Direct contact is the surest way to transfer life force.
Step aside, {arg}. Demigod coming through.
I can be everywhere, and yet be nowhere.
I must be quick before the meal grows cold.
You must be dead to be like me, yes, but not like that!
Pffaaaah. You call that life energy? Foulness runs in your veins.
Maybe I will make you my lackey. Maybe not.
Sic Semper Tyrannis!
Do not be ashamed, I have seen empires rise and fall.
It will comfort you to know that I have not had this much fun in ages.
I can see that you fight for what you believe in.
**Sniff** ... **sniff**. Did you soil yourself, {arg}?
Mother admonished me not to play with my food, but it's so much fun.
Patriotrism is indeed the last resort of a scoundrel.
Eternal unlife sucks.
I fought and died to make men free ... many times.
Do you come here often?
To fight and die for what ~one believes, that is a worthy life.
Give me Liberty or give me... oh, I think {arg} looks tasty.
General Washington gave me this scarf.
You remind me of that Benedict Arnold character, {arg}.
If need be, I can survive on the life energy of the occasional , animal, .
Why yes, Ben Franklin did program me.
Xaero reminds me of the Vampire who made me this way.
Make it challenging!
There are no guns in Heaven, so this must Hell again.
Time to face your deepest fears, {arg}. Have you got it in you?
Let's give the alien bastards a show they won't soon forget.
Good hunting ... I'm finding {chan} a little slow.
Does it always have to be {chan}? I'm off to find a better battle!
Another group of fresh recruits ... although I prefer to call them 'targets.'
Let the operation commence!
Battle stations!
Prepare to repel the enemy!
Once more into the breach!
Finally it starts to get interesting.
Betrayed into the hands of fiends again.
Unacceptable! I will not let my superiors down!
If {arg} would have stayed out of my way, the battle would have turned!
It could be worse. Look at {arg}, for example.
A true leader will always finish first!
A ~Marine finds a way! Don't whine, don't complain, just find a way!
Careful planning and good execution are the keys to victory.
I win ... and no ~one is surprised.
Pfah! I think I still have {arg}'s entrails on me!
Bag them and tag them!
~One promise: this is not going to happen again.
I do what I do to preserve the human way of life. Do not question me.
I no longer trust {arg} to fight fairly.
This was not an acceptable outcome to this mission.
You're going to die horribly, {arg}! Your slimy tactics insult us all!
How unfortunate that toads like {arg} are allowed in here.
I told you to put your safety on! Report for administrative punishment!
Inhuman scum!
Traitor!
Such treachery will not go unpunished!
That pin-prick is not going stop me from dominating {chan}.
Well done, {arg}. Your skills are indeed worthy. Shall we duel?
Typical attack of the under-educated opponent!
Bravo, {arg}! You make a superior practice target.
Bah, it is merely a flesh wound. Stand up and start running!
Okay, {arg}, I will accept your unconditional surrender.
The chase! Ah, the thrill of the chase!
Drop the {arg} and step away from the wall!
Quite a concept ... being everywhere at once!
I am indeed 'a real nowhere man.'
Sharing the same space with Crash would be a treat.
Sharing the same space with , femalebot,  would be a treat.
I did better in jump school.
That cursed ledge needs a safety ~rail.
Sprinkle my ashes among those of my fellow officers.
It's so hard to tell the difference between real slime and the aliens.
Argh! Bioweapons!
I bet I can hold my breath longer than you.
It's a good thing my battle armor is waterproof.
This is not what you think ... it just makes it easier to do push-ups.
My gloves will come off if you wish to make war like this!
Is that the same {arg} that you were picking your nose with, {arg}?
I must talk with HQ about these 'improved' bullet-proof jackets.
{arg} is the perfect weapon for cowards like {arg}.
So this is the light at the end of the tunnel everyone talks about.	
I think this passes the weapon effectiveness evaluation. 
Blast! Allowing you to kill me {arg} is an insult to this uniform.
Bah. I'll wager you can't repeat that accident.
Coward. Look me in the eye next time if you dare.
Congratulations, {arg}, I am victim to your victor.
With you in my squad, we could take on the rest of these , fighter, s.
I salute you for a shot well placed, {arg}.
Rule #1, 'Avoid big bullets.'
Rule #2, 'It is better to give than receive.'
Rule #3, 'Don't let your lame, ~pansy, camping butt get anywhere in range of my return fire.'
I guess {arg} is too fragile to handle a real punch.
Where I come from, we call that a 'glass jaw,' {arg}.
I love the smell of toasted carcass in the morning!
This is a new weapon, I think. I'm going to have to try it again.
You have a very unusual technique, {arg}. Is this to confuse your enemies?
~Three words, {arg}. 'Be more careful.'
Keep your distance, {arg}. I won't get caught hanging around with anyone that stupid.
I do not hold your inferiority against you, {arg}.
Evolution predicted your extinction long ago, {arg}.
'Kidnapped by Demonic Aliens' is a poor excuse for lack of skill, {arg}.
My heart aches when such a worthy adversary must perish.
Touche'! Be proud, {arg}, you died bravely.
Run freaks! Run while you still can!
Let me throw out a new word to {arg}. 'Tactics.'
Is {arg} trying to give us the impression that by firing continuously ~one may hit something?
Your fear of death will be your downfall, {arg}.
Stupidity is not to be confused with bravery.
Wearing 'Eau de Cat Box' again, {arg}? At least I can smell you coming. 
{arg}, please tell me why you seem to enjoy dying so often?
Apparently {arg} has camped the {chan} before.
This is all so terribly real.
My spirit is indomitable. I will persevere and survive this.
What in the universe did you do to earn this billet, {arg}?
{arg}, you grab the , 5,  and I'll grab the , 5, . We'll own this place!
Special orders for , 4 ,: ... 'Remove all hostiles!'
Where have the portals taken me now?
~Ranger reporting in. Am engaging the enemy in close combat.
I'm surrounded by Quake minions. Laying down suppressing fire.
Negative. Negative. I'm going in.
~Ranger to Base. , negative, , I can handle the opposition here.
~Ranger to Base. , affirmative, , We're good to go here.
~Ranger to base ... evac of {chan} commencing!
I'm going for reinforcements! Cover me!
We're pulling out ...
Go! Go! Go!
You set 'em up, I'll knock 'em down!
Commencing operation , operation{arg} , operation{arg}.
Hey, {arg}, you train with the SEALS?
A win's a win, but that was a waste of freaking time.
This operation's outcome is not acceptable.
All in a day's work.
Semper fi, do or die! Semper fi, I did, you died!
Hey, {arg}, you sissied out of boot camp, didn't you?
Ranger to base.{chan} is secured. Phase two can begin. Over.
Operation , operation{arg} , operation{arg} is complete. Mission objectives obtained.
Failure is not a part of a ~Marine's vocabulary.
Operation , operation{arg} , operation{arg} has failed to achieve its objective.
Freaking Navy-issue equipment!
Son-of-a-butt-smellin'-momma-dog!
~Ranger to base. Mission Objectives not attainable. Permission to withdraw requested.
The Enemy has bested us.
Here's a dime, {arg}. Call the chaplain. You're gonna need him.
That confirms that I have the moral high ground here.
Combatants will respect the Geneva Conventions.
I wasn't mad until now, , fighter, .
You're just pissin' me off, {arg}.
I've cut farts that hurt more than that.
Nice shot, private-first-class-wiseguy.
{arg}, I'm gonna rip your arm off and beat you to death with it.
Not using regulation ordinance again, eh {arg}.
I'm gonna convene a ~one man court martial right now.
I'm goin' slow, cuz I like the look on your face, , fighter, .
Stay still, {arg}, so I can connect the dots.
You got guts, {arg}. I can see most of 'em now.
Gotta correct my aim for windage.
Not dead? Must be defective ordinance.
Let me guess, {arg}. That was a headshot.
What brainy-butt occifer plotted this course?
I hate portals with a freakin' passion.
Wasn't I issued a parachute?
I failed FLYING 101 in Basic.
It's just form-fitting armor. Wait till it cools.
They taught me to keep my head down.
Stop, drop, and roll!
Nope. Still hate this stuff.
MRE production plant. Freakin' great.
I hope I can get a shot to clear this up.
Ranger to Base: Toxic Spill complicating operation , operation{arg} , operation{arg}.
Dropped the chute on the LV a bit early, didn't we?
Join the Navy, they said. See the world, they said ... 
In a blaze of glory! Oh, hell, at least it's a blaze.
Now that I've demonstrated how NOT to do it ...
I knew you were there, {arg}. I was just testing you.
Whatever happened to waiting till you see the whites of their eyes?
I hate taking the point.
MEDIC!
Incoming! Lots of incoming!
Best trophy you'll ever get, scumbag.
So your momma's apron proved to be good armor. Big deal.
~Ranger to Base, we're under heavy fire here.
Okay, {arg}, I'd salute you ... if I could find my head!
I'd give you my boots, but I don't think you could fill 'em!
I can respect a shot like that, {arg}.
Pin me up and call me a target. An outstanding shot, {arg}.
SBD, Silent But Deadly... and I ain't talking spicy food.
I just don't get to use these ~railgun's often enough.
'Mr. Glove' just wanted to be friendly, {arg}.
See, U sed to have this axe....
See how close I can get, {arg}? I can whisper in your ear.
Call me ~Ranger, human hand-grenade.
Way to go, kamikaze. Next time rent a plane.
That's the coward's way out, {arg}.
Trying to go negative on me, eh, {arg}?
There's a letter your Mommy don't want to see, {arg}!
I'd take your dog-tags, {arg}, but there's no market for baby bracelets.
You quit in the third minute of basic training, right {arg}?
~Ranger to Base, the enemy is taking heavy losses.
You practiced with paint-balls, didn't you, {arg}?
Well done, {arg}, we'll put a flag on your box.
You almost got it right, maggot.
You got 'retreat' down to a science, don't you, {arg}?
Hey, {arg}, get that butt down. Oh, that's your head.
If I gave myself a sucking chest wound, you'd still lose, {arg}.
Surrender and it will go easier for you.
Hey, {arg}, is my gig-line straight?
From the Halls of Montezuma ... hmm hmm hmm ... hey, anyone know the rest of it?
Operation , operation{arg} , operation{arg} is runnin' smooth as silk.
Surrender is not an option.
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.
For the right offer, I could probably let you get out of here.
The game's afoot!
Time to move on to better hunting grounds.
Hitting the road again ... 
Parting 'tis sweet sorrow ... 
Ah, {chan}. I know this place so very well.
Welcome to my zone of pain ... well, it's really just your pain that interests me.
What a coincidence, meeting you all here again.
Welcome! Just leave your valuables with my assistant.
All this fighting doesn't leave much time for my boys to practice their dancing.
Don't smile, {arg}. You just got a whole convoy looking for your sorry behind.
Here's a career pointer, {arg}... Learn to cook.
{chan} looks so much better when I turn you all into little stains.
I win! Alas, no mountains left to climb.
And you're wondering, how can ~one man be so good?
Hey, {arg}. Just to be sporting next time, I'll lash you to death with my tongue.
Conventional wisdom says no fooling before a match ... I should've listened, eh?
Okay, winner buys the first round.
I'm afraid I'm not taking this at all well.
Argh! Foul! Foul, I say!
The old brick-in-the-gauntlet trick, eh, {arg}?
I try, oh how I try to observe the rules. All bets are off, now.
Well done, {arg}, Well done!
My, my, {arg}. Getting a bit big for your britches, eh?
I definitely didn't enjoy that.
Well, I'm waiting for an apology, {arg}.
I hear the pitter-patter of dripping blood. Must be yours, {arg}.
Quit crowding the road!
Have you no manners? I was here first.
I can see the grou ... 
I always wanted to jump a canyon on my hog ... but this is ridiculous.
This isn't going well with the Mexican dinner special I just ate.
And here I forgot to bring marshmallows.
It's a luau, and I'm the roast long pig.
I'm the toast with the most!
Somebody forgot to clean the spa! Oo oo oo!
A bit too much caffeine for my tastes.
A spoon, a spoon! My kingdom for a spoon!
Roto-Ryders just hate oil... or whatever... slicks.
Aren't there government agencies that deal with this stuff?
I think I just found a batch of melted politicians.
And here I am wearing dry clean only.
Well, I guess I can't drink my way out of this ~one.
I think we can safely assume that the drought is over.
Could somebody get me a towel?
Call me a looney, but I think I saw the blue jet down there.
See, it takes a god to kill a god.
I'm always willing to make a noble sacrifice.
There, {arg}. That should help you catch up.
Okay, okay, but don't touch the bike!
Why is my hair standing up straight? Oh, not the hair, man!
So, {arg}, you can use a gauntlet without hurting yourself.
I didn't even hear the shot.
See what happens when they let children play with guns.
I thought I recognized that ~rail trail color, {arg}.
Drat! The house maids aren't due for another ~two days.
Whoa, I feel like I just got locked up with a convoy of ~eighteen wheelers.
I would have sworn that the BFG was banned by the Arena Masters.
Now I know how a ~bug on a windshield feels.
Lucky and good aren't the same thing.
Next time, try it with your eyes open, junior.
Ouch!
The road is yours now, {arg}. Use it well.
Okay, so I can't beat you with ~one hand tied behind my back, {arg}.
Wow, was that the new and improved {arg}?
Just a whisper on the wind, eh? Not!
Adopt a highway, skidmark.
So you're a member of the 'slow-moving target gang,' eh, {arg}.? 
Look, I'm a ~bug light.
Think I'll use this to weld a new tailpipe on my bike next.
Sorry, {arg}, gotta run. Bitterman needs a jump start.
Hey, {arg}, it's not my fault. I skidded on the sand.
Thanks for cushioning the entry, {arg}.
Pull yourself together friend!
Sorry. I didn't know this stall was occupied.
I'm next, right?
I like your technique, , 0 ,. Could you show me that again?
**[shakes head]**
Bravo, {arg}! It's not everyone who can frag themselves with their own gauntlet.
How many times do I have to kill you before you get a clue, {arg}?
The joy I have in wiping out galactic scum like {arg} is incredible.
It was an honor to kill you, {arg}... I'll gladly do it again and again.
You're good, {arg}, but only the best can survive.
You are a challenging target, {arg}.
Nothing personal ... well, seeing you, {arg}, it becomes personal.
{arg}, you smell too wretched to even think of hiding.
If owning the road means having {arg} as a tenant, I'm giving the road back!
The bigger they are the harder they fall ... and you look about redwood-sized.
Prepare to be stomped!
You don't look so scary to me.
The shades are bionic, but the baby-blues behind them are all mine.
No, the Roto-Ryders don't clean drains. That's someone else.
Shades fogging again? I must have lost a seal on these things.
Is this some kind of entertainment ritual?
So this is what you rogues call entertainment.
I'd keep an eye on that storm coming in, if I were you.
A rather studious looking ensemble, if I do say so myself.
ohmigod.
You've just violated my third law of fairness, {arg}.
Threedy Relmz? Oh, you mean ol' Duke!'
Hey, {arg}, wanna buy a full dresser?
We're not a gang, we're a club!
Mmmmm...  Smells like fresh meat.
~TEN-SHUN! ~Sarge is in the House.  
Alright, ~Hero. It's time for some Pain. 
*SNIFF* I smell victory in the air today.
You think you got what it takes to beat me, {arg}?
Keep up the pace soldiers. I'm up for some ~R and ~R.
Duty calls. Try to keep from fragging yourselves.
Duty calls.
Alright, Heroes. It's time for some ^1Pain. 
Everyone drop and give me 20!
Let's get this over with.
It's time to separate the warriors from the kiddies.
Well fought troops. Well fought.
I think we all earned a medal for that ~one.
You call that a good match? Sloppy. Very sloppy.
You call that effort? You're not worthy of my ordinance, pissant.
Yeah! Better luck next time, {arg}.
You gave it a good shot, {arg}, but next time I won't be so gentle.
I'm feeling mighty fine right now. Mighty fine indeed.
Yeah! The sweet smell of victory.
I wish my momma could've been here to see this day.
Frag off. I'll see you again, Jumping Junior.
Nice shootin' Fragbait. Just don't be getting' cocky.
Little Pig, you just won by the hair of your chinny chin, chin.
Fragbait.
There will be some serious payback for this.
Gloat while you can, fragbait. Gloat while you can.
Looks like ol' ~Sarge's tactics could use some re-evaluation.
What is it that you don't understand about a fair fight, fragbait?
You've just moved to the top of my hit list, {arg}.
Shootin' a man while he's talkin' just rubs me raw, {arg}.
You comin' on to me, Private?
Bring it on!  Bring it on! 
It'd be quicker if you just hold still.
That's just me bein' friendly.
This your first day with that weapon, {arg}?
Oooo.  Don'tcha just hate it when that happens.
Get that , fighter,  to the infirmary!
Barely enough to send home to Momma.
Rrrrrr. 
Well I'll be a son-of-a ... gun.
That's gonna cost you a month of K-P duty, {arg}!
I didn't come here to be barbequed.
Blast! Was it my turn to bring the marshmallows?
Horrible stuff.
Rrrrrr. 
I think I had that slime crap in an MRE once.
I'm Army, not some waterlogged ~Marine.
Oooo. Don'tcha just hate it when that happens.
Accidents happen.
This battlefield is booby-trapped!
I did that to make the odds more fair.
That's no way for a warrior to die.
There are worse ways to die ...
No ~one said ANYTHING about land mines!
Rrrrrr. 
You comin' on to me, , fighter, ?
You're allowed to do that just once, soldier.
That's an ugly way to die.
Everyone gets lucky, once in awhile, {arg}.
Dirty, rotten, lousy sniper.
A lucky shot, {arg}.
A real soldier can't depend on weapons of mass destruction.
Next time, Private, face to face like real soldiers.
Worthless fragbait.
Your mommy say you could use that big gun, {arg}?
Wipe that smile off your face, {arg}. You ~ain't out of the woods yet.
Anybody can be lucky once, fragbait. Do you understand me?
You can dish it out, {arg}. But can you take it?
My dog could have done that better and quicker.
Sloppy, soldier. Very sloppy.
That was my favorite cigar back there. Now I'm angry.
Finally! Is someone else doing the aiming for you now, {arg}?
You've had your lucky shot for the day, {arg}.
I'll bet you expect to get a medal for doing that, eh {arg}?
Nice shootin', Fragbait. Just don't be getting' cocky.
Well, {arg}. There's hope for you yet, soldier.
Good shooting.
You see, {arg}, practice does pay off in the long run.
I see you've been practicing again, {arg}.
We'll make a soldier out of you yet, ,{arg}.
Alright! 
Remind me to show you my sharpshooter ribbon.
This is a truly fine weapon.
Lesson Number ~One: Never let the enemy get that close.
That's just me bein' friendly, {arg}.
Alright! 
Let that be a lesson to you soldier ... move your butt next time.
It's just like a bad dream ain't it.
Get used to it, fragbait.
Alright. That's more like it.
Whole lot more where that came from.
Heheh. Now you come in wallet size, {arg}.
This your first day with that weapon?
Let that be a lesso, {arg}... move your butt next time.
It'd be quicker, {arg}, if you just hold still.
Move around more, fragbait! You're too easy a target.
You'd last about ~two seconds in a real shootin' war, {arg}.
{arg}, you are making this far too easy.
Fancy move, {arg}.  But it still got you killed.
Finally, a challenge worthy of my skills.
You may lose, {arg}, but you don't have to like it.
I see you've been practicing again, {arg}.
We'll make a soldier out of you yet, {arg}.
Rrrrrr. 
It'd be quicker if you just hold still, {arg}.
Does your mommy know you're here, {arg}?
You're not naturally bad, {arg}. What you got takes practice.
You want a piece of me?  You gotta take it the hard way!
Come and get me fragbait.
My old granny would be opening a can of whoopass here.
Smells like a latrine. Or is that {arg}'s cologne?
What?  You waitin' for your nails to dry, {arg}?
Alright! 
Rrrrrr.  
Yeah! 
Bring it on! Bring it on! 
You bring any cigars with you {arg}? I'm almost out.
This is all some kind of game to you, isn't it?
It's time to wrap this up and move on.
Move your sorry butt around more, {arg}!  You're too easy a target.
{arg}, you'd last about ~two seconds in a real shootin' war.
Konnichiwa, campers.
Ooooo. Gimme some room, I feel a victory comin' on.
My wetware is hot tonight!
I'm ready to log in and get virtual.
Been here, done this and am ready to do it again.
Whoaaaa. I need a global positioning implant to find my way around in here.
Like, dibs on the BFG!
Sayonara, babies.
I'm going offline.
Like, I feel a ~major download comin' on. Gotta scoot.
Been here, done this and am ready to do it again.
I'm ready to jack in and get virtual.
So soon?. Like, I'm not breathing hard yet.
I see I underestimated you fellows.
Winning comes naturally to me.
I think I'll have my gun bronzed.
This is, like, so sweet.
I have brought, y'know, dishonor to those who trusted me.
Where I come from, they don't, like, teach you how to lose.
I just hate losing.
I can't believe you shot me while I was talking, {arg}!
I'll guess you're not a very popular person, {arg}.
That was ~one cheap shot you took there, {arg}.
Ow! Right through the cell phone.
You'll have to do better than that to keep this blade-lady down.
Nice shot, {arg}. But definitely not nice enough.
Oooooo! You like me. You really like me.!
Frack! Do you know how it is to replace those implants, {arg}?
~One shot, ~one .... Ok, I guess I'll have to make it ~two shots.
You've been whoring the armor again, {arg}, haven't you?
Don't run off, {arg}, I've got more just like that for you.
Laughing? Me? Of course I'm laughing at you, {arg}.
Wow! Do you do that often, {arg}?
Death by papercut. What a terrible way to go.
Wooohooo. Can we catch that on instant replay, {arg}?
no way....
That lava stuff really messes with my wetware.
I'm gonna need another cooling fan implant.
That slime reminds me of a guy I once dated.
It's 'Slime Time' again.
That slime overloaded my implants.
All that water and no hunky lifeguards. No beach either.
If I were meant to swim, I'd have gill implants.
Did I give you permission to touch me?
Y'know, that really pisses me off.
That won't happen again.
Camping Scum!
So. Like, I suppose you never off yourself? Right?
Like, 'Ow.'
There is, like, no honor in wasting ~one's self like that.
I, like, take special delight in fragging BFG campers.
That was a mistake. You've made me, like, very angry now.
Gross! Like, fragged by my own fave tool.
Like, am I supposed to be impressed by that?
Son of a ...? Am I, like, some kind of loser magnet?
Totally uncool. Totally.
This match might be, like, interesting after all.
Consider yourself lucky. I only let the Adrianator do that.
Nice moves! Like, are they yours or implants?
I love modern technology.
So I'm a camper. Sue me.
Ka-POW!! **[giggle]**
Not a BFG, but I, like, do what I can.
Nothing like a friendly touch to make a girl's day.
I've got more where that came from.
That was so wrong in all the right ways
Too much data, not enough storage.
I'm a terminal download!
Wrongful!
And the Lady Slash scores again.
You dance really fine, babe. Just not fast enough.
Nice moves, but not quick enough, {arg}.
Hey, {arg} Let's see you try that move with skates on.!
You! {arg}! Out of the gene pool!
Did you buy those implants in a pawn shop, {arg}?
Can't you , fighter, s die with a little more style than that?
Like the skates?
I so love a challenge. But I guess I have to take what I'm given.
Zaphod?  Isn't he just 'some guy'?
{chan} is-sss the most favored of hunting grounds.
So many choice ss-specimens to con-ss-sider.
A pity us-sss must waste such fine resourcessss.
Sss-sorlag comes.
Mmm, {arg}'s spleen buy me a ss-supper.
{arg}, you too droopy to ssell. I eats you instead.
Nothing here worth the harves-ssting.
Sss-sorlag goes.
All ss-stand ss-still. Sss-sorlag kill quick. No much pain. Sss-sorlag promissse.
Kidneys-ss? Ss-sorlag smell. Ss-sorlag harvest. Ss-sorlag sell.
Lucky sss-scum are you, that us didn't get claws-sss on you, {arg}.
Again. Again! Match not fair. Us-ss not win.
Let us-sss go!! Much to harvest. Not to waste!
Fat ~one! Intestines sss-sell by foot.
Harvest comes early. Us-sss only takes most choice.
Not kill all ... too many rot before us-ss can harvest.
Us-sss mus-sss-t remember sss-second body bag next time.
Hiss-ss!
You thinks you good? Sorlag collect you-sses liver next!
Us is just making you , fighter, s worth-sss more!
Sssso, you desperate to ss-save sss-spleen from us ssss-scalpel.
Alien ss-scum! Con-sss-istent you are.
Ssssss!
Us kill you dead, {arg}!!
It bites us back, it does.
Ssssss!!! For that, Sss-sorlag must destroy it.
Vivisection soon for {arg}. Take parts-ss while still live.
Best to take merchandise alive.
Die fas-ssst, , fighter, . Damage goods less-sss.
Sorlag sell you piece by piece if us must, {arg}.
Us-ss slow {arg} down, then Ss-sorlag kills it.
Yes-ssssss!
Like sorg death rite. No body to sss-sell.
Hissss!
Arrrgh! All broken.
Curses-sss!
Heat too much. Sss-scales not compensate.
It burns us-ss! It burns us-ss!
To my thongue ith thticksth.
Mmmmm. Like Sss-sorg mating jelly.
Sss-sorg not fissss-sh. This-sss bad!
Ssssss. Us-ss clumsy like mammal.
us likes to kill so much, us kills us.
Put your hand back... Us bites off you fingers!
Wretched {arg}! Us-ss carve pieces off you later.
Good weapon. Like Sss-surgeon sss-scalpel in gun.
AAAARGGGH!!!! So much us hateses sss-sniper!
All ruined. Bad gun. Wasteful.
Droppings-ss!
Us take, sss-sell people of Hunter. Do sss-same to you people, {arg}.
Us find you, , fighter, . Repay insss-sult!
Is you tasty, {arg}? Us-sss find out soon.
Worthy sss-savage. Us think you parts sss-sell good.
Well does-ss {arg} ssss-shoot.  Too well ... hsss.
Sss-shoot clean ... more to dissect and sss-sell.
Sss-sorlag hopes us not hit exsss-pensive parts.
Fry no organs-ss ... Cyborg makes buy much, pay good.
Good anger release. Sss-sorlag not sss-so mad now.
No!!! Us needs those pieces!
Sss-shameful wastings.
Improving the breed, I ss-see, {arg}.
Presents, presents everywhere. Is-sss my hatch-day?
Us thank you, {arg}. You brings-ss us profit with no overhead.
Die slow, {arg}.  Us sss-show you pieces as us take out.
Ummmmm. Some pieces tastes good.
Oo-oops-sss. Too much snacking on good partssss.
No good sell parts in {arg}.  Us make into protein chowder.
Many credits us would gets for you, {arg}.
{arg} looks-sss better harvested.
~Sorlag want to clone {arg}. Then sss-sell many time.
When with you, us am done, Sorlag kill your dog.
Whisper, whisper ... you ears us clean with us forked tongue.
Good shooting eye, {arg}. Sorlag think us dig out and sell.
Catch it? Hmmm? Will Cyborg makers buy it whole?
I sss-sense body heat ... hot blood ... profit!!
Intes-ssstine make good floss-sss.
Y'all got your boots on. Let's get busy.
I lived in worse places than, {chan}.
All the comforts of home and good company too.
Y'all don't want to get on my bad side today.
All y'all just got lucky, , fighter, s. Duty calls.
No ~bugs to squash in {chan}.
Show me what y'll got, ~bug-lover.
Come on junior, let's see what y'all got.
I feel like I just kissed my sista'.
I might as well start raising pigeons.
You're excused, {arg}. But {arg} , I'm gonna pay you back good.
What else would ya'll expect from an elite killing machine?
Move like a dragonfly, hit like a tank, I looked pretty, but y'all don't even rank.
I expect you to salute your superiors, {arg}.
I'm a disgrace to the Legion.
Where were y'all when I was on Beta-3?
Go hunt some ~bugs, {arg}.
Y'all wanna street fight punk? YOU GOT IT! 
All's fair in love and war, right?  Y'all are so WRONG, , fighter, !!
Y'all don't go messing with ~Stripe!  
Either I'm getting slow or y'all're using a sloppy weapon.
{arg}, y'all are beginning to irritate me.
I must have a tracer on me.
Don't play games with me, {arg}.
Y'all hit the man, he supposed to stay down. Y'all messed up.
I wish I had my .44.
Look at {arg} go!  bet that , fighter,  could outrun police dogs!
Last time I shot something that ran as fast as y'all, I cooked it for dinner.
Be nice if they give us some live ammo.
Get out of my head!
What is this?  A friggin' turf war?
I wish I was wearing my game shoes.
Double-pump, 360 slam!
And I thought Louisiana Hot Sauce was hot.
Man! Almost as hot as a Texas summer.
AAAAAAAAH! ~Bug dip.
They didn't cover this in basic.
Well that's just great. Who broke the hydrant?
That's not right.
I never was a good rebounder.
Y'all are definitely outta bounds there, {arg}.
I might as well put on a dress and go back to the pen.
Lean on the car and spread 'em, right?
Do that again and I'll cut you, man!
I didn't know I was within ~five feet of the fence.
That gun don't mess around.
Y'all put that thing down, {arg}. Don't go messing with what you can't handle.
Now I know what a piece of toast feels like.
Y'all don't got the training to use that piece of heat.
Oh, so you want to play rough?
You piece of crap! Are you wearing a rabbit's foot?
Consider yourself lucky, {arg}. You just offed a bonafide war ~hero.
Just get my name right on the tombstone, , fighter, .
Y'all give a new meaning to reach out and touch someone, {arg}.
Y'all are ~one messed up , fighter,  now, {arg}.
Get off my turf!
There's ~one monkey off my back.
Y'all can't nap in the stall like that, {arg}.
I figured y'all forgot to flush, {arg}. So I done it for y'all.
Taking the easy way out, eh?
Step TO the edge, brainchild. Not OVER it!
First time with live ammo, , fighter, ?
The ~bugs in the kitchen gave me more of a fight than y'all did, {arg}.
Let's hope you never go to prison.
Yo, {arg}! You take that target off when y'all sleep?
Y'all Consider yourself honored. I'm a trained professional.
Y'all were a worthy opponent, for an amateur.
Are y'all gonna fire that thing or just put us on a fashion show?
Does your momma know where y'all are, {arg}?
Does {chan} feel like home to y'all? Good, cuz they'll bury y'all here.
Y'all needs to practice more with live ammo.
Firing them video guns in the arcade don't count as field training.
I can't believe I still have my safety on.
I could go for a big plate of , food, , the way my momma made it.

Mother, is that you?
My wings do droop in anticipation.
How many must I kill before my scale is balanced again?
{chan}. This place looks too familiar.
The call of the ages beckons me once again.
Tremble, mortals, Uriel returns to {chan}.
I am doomed to return. There will be no rest.
Perhaps I will find some worthy to ascend... next time.
My rest will be short, of that, I am sure.
Farewell. Even Death takes a holiday.
Again I am summoned to show insects the way to perfection.
I am the darkness and the way.
This place is filled with inferior beings.
This will not take much time or ammunition.
Tremble, mortals, and more so if you survive.
Some will ascend. Others must try again.
It all blends together.
 **sigh** And now again... always again... ever again.
Eternal is the Arena... I fear that more than I fear you, {arg}.
I am mired in the midst of foolish ambition.
Defeat is not you greatest worry, {arg}. That will be victory.
What is it that you have truly won, {arg}?
Behold the Dark Angel of Death!
I take no pleasure in killing you {arg}. It is expected.
There can be no other outcome, lesser ones.
Do you not understand who I am?
Where is the thrill?
Defeat is not you greatest worry, {arg}. That will be victory.
If you defeat a thousand, this will remain your greatest trophy, {arg}.
Perhaps there is rest, at last.
Too long have I toiled to sate the egos of inferiors.
Move on, {arg}. Ascend, and then descend, and know despair.
Where the heart cannot go, the body cannot follow.
Weigh carefully the choice of being victorious, {arg}.
Your deceptions will not elevate you, {arg}.
Too long have I lived to suffer such cowardly acts, {arg}.
Your treachery will find you out, {arg}.
{arg}! Shoot straighter, I say! For the heart!
Scars upon scars upon scars.
Curse this life!
You think yourself worthy, {arg}? Prove it.
I must retaliate. It is the way.
Is there no end to this madness? Nay, none, and so your death will not be swift, {arg}.
Only a child should weep so.
{arg}, you would not last a span of ~five heartbeats in Vadrigar.
Insignificant worm. You spill your life upon halls stained by the blood of thousands.?
Ah, the eternal sound: an inferior wailing in agony.
A thousand times a thousand rockets will not bring you the pain I have known, {arg}. 
Is this the life you willingly choose, {arg}?
They crowd the Arena, eager to ascend... but there is only death.
A fit end for an insect, {arg}.
Too close to the sun have I flown, and thus my wings are no more.
I fly on wings of lead!
I will rise again, I fear.
Sweet heat, release me these mortal bonds.
Encase me, molten stone. A fitting statue for the Dark Angel.
I burn. I care not at all.
Indignity. Once I ruled, now ...
In the end, the slime will rule and all the rest shall be dust.
All my life I see before me. There is only pain.
Darkness take me, before I rise up, only to fall again.
There is a peacefulness here that is appealing.
'Tis my own doing ... none shall ascend!
Was this done on purpose? I must examine that which is in my heart.
I have lost my edge. The mighty have fallen.
Immortal weariness has stolen my edge.
Are you worthy to ascend, {arg}? Or have I sunk so low?
The ages have diminished the mighty to the level of ... {arg}.
The mewling child dares swing at the father?
I did not see it, {arg}... that is preferred.
How? Where? Nay, the question is 'why?'
There is promise in ~one who displays such stealth, {arg}.
Sudden and without warning, {arg}... you have perfected one aspect of death.
But how would you fight without such firepower, {arg}?
It is a challenge reduced to throw weight. There is no honor.
Scatter me across all the world, {arg}.
I pray that this mighty weapon is enough power to end my reign.
Now you learn the truth, {arg}.
Rejoice not, {arg}. All victory is temporary.
You are not worthy, {arg}. You are merely lucky, and luck cannot hold.
~One frag does not an Arena Lord make, {arg}!
If only you understood the truth: that I let you win.
Dance not, puny ~one. The eons felled me, not {arg}.
What is it that you have truly won, {arg}?
Your cheers reveal your ignorance, {arg}.
Attach my wings to your coil if you can {arg}. Wear them with pride.
Behold ye, the new Dark Angel of Death. Enjoy this time of ignorance.
I fall to you, {arg}, but there are levels you must yet scale.
I honor you in deaths prayer, {arg} ... may your fall will be as swift as your rise.
May death find you in battle, {arg}, and quickly, before you begin the long descent.
Has the Arena found its next champion?
I prefer not this weapon, but neither would I waste my time in battling you, {arg}.
Ignorance is bliss, but only if bliss is death.
Sometimes it is preferable not to hear the serpent's rattle.
Go home, puny ~one, this is not your place.
I waste no ammo on the likes of you, {arg}.
The touch of Death. Cold ...
The fates have deemed you unworthy {arg}... obviously.
Just go away.
Why do I bother?
Hmmph. Hmmmph. This is what you must call humor.
Well done. You do excel at some things, {arg}.
It could go on without me, I see.
A feint within a feint? Or are you just dead {arg}?
Bah! Each new round brings an opponent less worthy.
The ease of your execution only heightens my boredom, {arg}.
I have forgotten your name already.
Your race weakens with the eons... your ancestors would still be alive.
There are many ways to die. I suspect that you have perfected them all, {arg}.
In a thousand years, I have never seen ~one as pitiful as thee, {arg}.
Too easy. Where has the challenge gone?
Trust me, I have done you a favor and an honor, {arg}.
If you so desire the life that I have known, try again. You may get there, {arg}.
The Lords shall be grateful that I killed you. You would have brought them pain, {arg}.
I will write your name in my great book ... that, I have not done for centuries untold.
The Dark Angel of Death has spoken. Hear his voice!
Show promise and learn well, and learn now that this is not the course for you, {arg}.
Run faster! Shoot straighter! Do something right and make this interesting, {arg}.
This is what they send me? The Masters' respect for me has waned, I fear.
I will defeat you, {arg}. That is assured.
Have you no skill, {arg}? Or have you just surrendered to the inevitable?
Kill yourself, {arg}, and save me the trouble.
{arg}, there is no belt small enough to carve a proper notch for you.
{arg}, you are a worthless , animal,  No! Less than worthless!
Yes, I know. I talk too much.
Me? I talk too much? You have yet to meet Xaero!
Miserable wings, fly me far from this place!
My talons once raked through stone. The stone is harder now, I fear.
The world is diminished! They let inferiors in here!
I know every inch of {chan}, every trap and every stain.
Heh. Fresh Meat.
Time to Rock 'n Roll.
Oh yeah! {chan} is where ~Visor lays down the law!
You know I'll be back.
I'm history. Later kids.
This place rocks!
{chan} rocks!
I'm ready to win.
Who needs a lesson today?
Alright. Make me look good.
Perhaps luck won't favor you next time, eh?
I won't make the same mistakes next time.
Only winning matters here.
I deserve this!
This is what it's all about, kid!
This is the reason you , fighter, s are here. To make me look good.
Grrrr.
Luck. Pure luck.
Next time, your butts are mine.
Next time, your butt is mine, {arg}!
There's no hole deep enough for you to hide in, {arg}.
{arg}, I'm gonna ram my gauntlet so far down your skinny throat, I'll untie your shoes.
That was cheap, and you know it, {arg}.
You saying I talk to much, {arg}?
You actually hit me, {arg}. I'm impressed, kid.
So kid, you going to make a habit of dinking ol' ~Visor?
Another scar to remember you by, {arg}.
I've stopped counting the scars.
That hurt, kid. But not enough to matter.
You survived? It's time to show you my latest move, {arg}.
I win the simple way, by out-fragging the competition.
I hope you heal fast kid, because there's more where that came from.
That'll sting in the morning.
That's it. Run for the health. I know where to find you.
There's only room for ~one of us behind the mask.
Lousy stuff.
This stuff makes me mad.
Whose idea was this?
I never get used to that stuff.
Get that slime in your cybronics and they're never the same again.
I knew I should have packed a snorkel for this trip.
Wish this ~visor was fitted with a scuba hook up.
Don't laugh kid, you've probably done this a lot.
I've gone and made a mess of myself again.
Will you stop touching me?
Do that again and you are toast.
Heh. Nice shot kid.
I hate campers. I really do.
Did ~Xian show you how to do that?
Meteor Shower from Hell!
Got any ammo left, punk? You're gonna need it.
Did you enjoy that?
I'll bet you enjoyed that more than I did, {arg}.
Oh, yeah. You had me good there kid.
Not bad kid.
Work on your follow through, kid.
You copied that move from me, didn't you, {arg}?
Yessssss!!
Gotcha!
You're it!
~Railguns rule my universe!
Thanks, {arg}. I love doing that!
Humiliation is the name of the game, kid.
Stand aside, kid. Whoops. Too late.
Nothing but memories left there.
Pick up your toys and go home kid.
I was told you were competition, {arg}. Somebody got that wrong.
Not bad, kid. Most don't last that long.
Almost didn't get you there, kid.
You will learn to fear me.
I will be your personal nightmare, kid.
Victory will be mine!
You can't win, {arg}. It's not in you to be a winner.
This is all I know. No ~one can take it from me.
They come by the millions, but I turn them all back.
Nothing fancy here, just solid skill.
I would be proud to be to your father, {arg}.
How much blood must I bathe in before I find peace?
This is {chan}? They've really cleaned this place up!
Aren't there supposed to be 'slipgates' here?
Come with me, {arg}. Find peace.
Gonna find me some fiends to frag.
Deja vu all over again ... aargh!
I'm having flashbacks.
And the sky was full of rockets.
Wish I had some real opponents here.
Why is everyone stopping? I'm still here ... I think...yeah, I am!
{arg} is bucking for sergeant.
{arg} should've stayed back in the mess hall.
Over already? I remember these things lasting for hours.
They don't train 'em like the used to.
{chan} always was sweet to me.
Don't take it personally,{arg}, I was doing this when you were in diapers.
Yeah. Technology over tactics. Big guns over good moves.
You proud, {arg}? You shouldn't be proud! That was lame!
They've changed this place. I remember {chan} before they messed it up.
I don't care what it freakin' says. ^1I DON'T LOSE.
Don't they teach etiquette in your clan, , fighter, .
I really hope that {arg} just misfired.
I remember when , fighter, s like you had better manners.
Can't jump right anymore, can't run fast. When I was younger ...
You're making it harder for me to go through airports... the bells, the bells!
~Pinged another ~one off the plate in my head. What're you shooting... magnets?
When I started fighting, you were in diapers, {arg}, and now, you need 'em again.
Stop screaming, {arg}! I can't hear the other voices in my head!
Wait, you're not 'Old Yeller!'
Leave me alone, {arg}! There's already too many people in here!
Stinkin' slipgates.
Nothing but static at this end.
Cats can do it, so can I!
Up, up, and away!  I'm a bird!  I'm a plane!
Used to fall a lot farther than that with no pain.
Let's see you do better, {arg}.
How did Cthon manage this stuff?
Hey, {arg}. Got any marshmallows?
Battle suits are for wimps. Give me an Enviro Suit any day.
KP again ... too much creamed corn ... way too much creamed corn.
Doesn't smell like liniment.
This stuff is primordial ooze.
I can't hear! Why can't I hear?
We had gills when I was a boy!
Hey, {arg}, throw me a lifesaver. And I don't mean candy!
Course I can swim.  Just didn't feel like it then.
This doesn't look like the well of wishes...
Too complicated. Used to be simple. Mano ~y mano.
Not the first time I've done this ...won't be the last.
Charlie got tougher in the jungle.
You just try that again when I'm drunk.
Sissy gun! Sissy gun! We wouldn't use crap like that in the old days!
Oh look, a viking burial! Hey wait, it's mine!
Whose bright idea was this weapon?
No-skill llama!
What're the fireworks for, {arg}?  Ow...never mind.
~Four years ago, I could've killed you with a projectile-shaped piece of earwax.
Yeah, in the old days, I had to walk a mile through ~six feet of snow to frag someone.
They make things too easy now. Anybody can fight here.
You're a long way from the elite, , fighter, .
And the old stallion is driven from the herd...
You fight like that for 30 years ... you just might be me someday.
Nice. You trained with the 'old ones,' didn't you, {arg}?
That you, G. Narley?
Woohoo! That was too easy. They're taking all the fun out of it.
Choo choo! Train's coming through!
I'd rather have a nail gun.
I'd rather have a 'Thunderbolt.'
In the old days, we cooked hot dogs like this.
Gimme back my axe! I hate this thing.
Way too easy.
No challenge here.
That's like putting an 8-track in a cassette deck!
I'm a slip-gating fool! Wahoooo!
Wait minute ... what's the point of this again?
Go as negative as you want, {arg}.
If you can't handle the heat, {arg}, stay outta the lava.
Lamebrain, , fighter, .
I've had better fights trying to put my pants on in the middle of the night.
I hate fraggin' them before they're old enough to drive.
You old enough to be here, {arg}? Can I see some ID.
Come back when you've improved enough to be competition, {arg}.
Age and treachery always overcome youth and skill. You bet!		
You done good, {arg}. Too bad you won't get to polish your technique.
You remind me of me in the old days ... course, I got better.
You've been watching ol' ~Wrack's moves, right, {arg}?
Wipe your nose, , fighter, . Your whiney sniffling's giving you away.
You want a little cheese with that whine, {arg}?
And I thought I didn't know where I was. You lost there, {arg}?
I got a cramp. Hey, {arg}, rub my leg.
Improve or die, , fighter, s. Improve or die.
I want to feel some more of your pain, {arg}.
And the sky was full of planes ...
Hey, {arg}! I need a , 5, . Think I'll take yours.
Now that we are all here, let the lesson begin.
Welcome unenlightened ones. Learn, and then die.
The bee is drawn to the flower, yet the spider lurks below.
Do I hear a sharp intake of breath? Did you not expect me?
Today's lesson will be pain.
Greetings, {arg}, You come for another lesson?
Would a dragon swat a fly simply because he could?
You could not stand in a gentle breeze, yet I am a hurricane.
Greater mountains to climb, though not yet have I found a challenge.
This day shall the new prophecy be written. Your blood shall be my ink.
Pray for a quick death, and if you are fortunate, I shall answer.
It is time for your first lesson: humility.
I can feel the terror as my shadow crosses the Arena.
Only through worthy opponents can I ascend beyond this.
I walk the edge of a fine sword. On ~one side, mediocrity. On the other, victory.
Confusing is the heat of battle. I fear the count is not correct.
At last the slate has been put to the chalk.
There is success, or failure. There is no mediocrity.
Only the Chosen can reveal the Chosen, {arg}. We are ~one in glory.
The sun rises. The sun sets. I win. These are the precepts of a logical world.
Wise is the warrior who appreciates his opponents. Alas, I am a fool.
The rain yields to the stream. The stream cowers before the river. I am the ocean.
Your blood is my wine ... my cup overfloweth.
All fall before me.
Your parts intermingle. I cannot sort them out.
At last, the irresistible force has met the immovable object.
The lesson I could not teach myself: to see battle through the eyes of my foes.
Now that I am finished stretching, the real fighting may commence.
Humility is a lesson that you will not teach to me.
You have not defeated me, you have freed me to seek the higher level.
Only time conquers all.
Only the Chosen can reveal the Chosen, {arg}. We are ~one in glory.
{arg}, it takes a child but once to learn that a flame will burn.
If there is not honor, I cannot teach. I will kill you without instruction, {arg}.
{arg}, when the master speaks, the student would do well to listen.
Grab every advantage, {arg}. It will not be enough.
This is no victory, {arg}, for glory pales with treachery.
Defiler!
Sacrilege!
The bee stings but once ... then it dies.
Follow the road of chance, child, but follow it to the end.
The instructor is pleased that you did not sleep through ALL of his lessons, {arg}.
The rungs of the ladder are narrow. There is no room to pass.
A true master kills with ~one shot {arg}.
The wind must have corrected your errant shot, {arg}.
That is the first of the ~seventeen points of pain, {arg}. ~Sixteen to go.
Well done, {arg}. You show the enviable ability to attract your foe's weapons.
Be proud of your scars, {arg}. They were given by the master.
Honor demands that you fall on a grenade {arg} for making such a whimper.
{arg}, the smell of your charred flesh is incense that speaks to my soul.
The beast is surrounded. Then it is struck. Then it tires. Then it dies.
Do not fear, {arg}, for your wound will have no time to fester.
That is but a hole through which the maggots might enter.
Alas, the coward will seek any means to victory.
The intervention of fate alone allows you this hollow victory, {arg}.
I descend from on high. Too fast, I fear.
Every creature finds its niche, where its form is perfection. Would that I was a bird!
Alas, gravity, the universal truths apply to all. Even to ~Xaero.
Alas, the elements beckon me.
I embark upon a river of stone, and the flames free my soul.
This is the essence of creation, and destruction.
Every creature finds its niche, where its form is perfection. Would that I were someplace else entirely.
The simplest creatures are oft the most deadly.
The willow bends to the wind, as the slime absorbs the strike. I am caught.
As it was in the beginning, so it shall be in the end.
The irony: that that which gave me life, now gives me death.
Every creature finds its niche, where its form is perfection. Would that I was a fish.
I know a thousand ways to kill, and yet, I could not spare a day to learn to swim.
Remember little ~one: he who is the best armored ... sinks.
How I have envied its perfect motion, and now at last, I join the fluid bath.
It would seem that I have to do for you that which you cannot do for yourselves.
A true warrior controls the fight, from beginning to end.
A true warriors does nothing without purpose.
In facing you, I have dishonored my sacred oath, and so I have fallen on my sword.
There is honor in dying ... sometimes.
I err. This is a new experience.
Even in death, I am greater than thee.
You show promise, {arg} ... perhaps too much so.
Perhaps I have underestimated you, {arg}.
You have touched perfection, {arg}. Can you grab onto it?
The snake can strike but once against the quick of hand.
I feel the sting of an insignificant wasp, and yet, I fear I am allergic.
You fear to face me openly, {arg}? You are wise beyond your years.
Your tactics offend the philosopher in me, {arg}.
Chaos reigns when a gnat is given the power of the bear.
I end in a green blaze. There could be no other way.
The candle that burns twice as fast, burns twice as bright.
Cowards cannot comprehend the joy of valor, {arg}.
The weak can win ... once.
It must be true: fate is a path of many unforeseeable twists and turns.
When all logic is cast aside, and all reason is reduced to madness, there is chaos.
Call the scribe. This is an occasion which you will want to remember, {arg}.
Brief are those moments of insanity, fortunately. Enjoy yours, {arg}.
Boast of this kill, {arg}. It is the ~one mask to hide the fool that is you.
Thrice cursed {arg} , animal, ! You will learn your manners.
There is no trophy greater. I pray you are worthy, {arg}.
You are my peer, {arg}. We are rare.
I will see you on the higher level, {arg}.
I salute you, {arg}, for magnificent deeds should not go unheralded.
My corpse is my shrine. Build well your own, {arg}.
You have taken a great step along the road to perfection.
I easily slide the thread through the eye of the needle.
You must learn to anticipate, little ~one.
A clean kill. Rejoice, {arg}, for I was merciful.
You die, {arg}. Any way I choose.
Often the master must take matters into his own 'hands'.
The true warrior is a shadow within the darkness, a whisper among shouts.
You see, {arg}? The scorpion has a tail.
Out of my way!
It is good to know that there was nothing of significance blocking my entrance.
Once there were people that honored such an act. They have inexplicably disappeared.
Why do you try to steal the serpent's strike, {arg}?
I agree with your choice, {arg}, for what was the point?
He who accepts the inevitable is not a fool, {arg}. But he is still dead.
You have taught me, little ~one, what not to do.
They say there is honor in death. Do not believe them, {arg}.
My soul for a true challenge!
They waste my time by feeding me insects like you.
The elephant steps on the ant. Does he even notice?
You should die childless. Your existence insults the theory of evolution.
There are among us those rare creatures who move better dead than alive.
You lived as a coward, {arg}. And you died as a coward.
With you in mind, {arg}, I tremble at the concept of reincarnation.
Have you encountered , botnames, ? That ~one failed against me also.
Fine is the line between risk and foolishness. You stepped too far, {arg}.
Great is better than good. I win.
Take heart, {arg}, for those who do not try, cannot win.
For a brief moment, you were a true fighter, {arg}. Sleep now, for that moment is passed.
{arg}, you have rekindled my hope that ~one day I will be truly challenged.
I have killed the likes of you a thousand times, {arg}. Warriors who nearly made the grade.
You walk as a drunkard, {arg}! ~One step ahead, ~two to the side, and ~three backwards.
I would kill you quickly, {arg}, if I wasn't taking such pleasure from your shortcomings.
Jump into the void, {arg} ...your chances will improve.
{arg}, what made you choose this road of utter annihilation?
They speak of bravery so that you will blindly walk to your death.
I will prove to you that you are made of the basic elements, {arg}.
Avoiding death by my hands is like avoiding fate itself.
Does your world truly see you as a champion, {arg}?
If you tremble upon seeing me, {arg}, you are a coward. If you do not, you are a fool.
What words of comfort would you have me tell your next of kin, {arg}?
Where am I on the scale? At the top, because I CAN kill? Or at the bottom, because I DO?
Tell me of your sensei, {arg}.
The hawk or the wolf? ~One works in concert, the other, alone.
Tell me of life outside the Arena.
Anarki annoys me. His very name speaks of chaos.
Perhaps I will keep you alive, {arg}, to serve as Klesk's translator.
